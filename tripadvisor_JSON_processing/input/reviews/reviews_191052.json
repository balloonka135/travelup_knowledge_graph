His organic style was inspired by nature and is totally magical.  We took an audio tour with an amazing device that not only gave us descriptions and history of what we were seeing, but also the ability to see (virtually) the furnishings and the overall look of each room, as it appeared when the Battlo family lived here. (There was no real furniture in the house.)  The initial staircase wound up to the 1st floor in typical Gaudi style\u2014no straight lines. We passed through a reception room decorated in brilliant golds, with a small mushroom-shaped cubby on one side containing a fireplace with benches on either side\u2014presumably for \u201cchaperoned\u201d visits with the daughters of the house. Beautiful honey-colored, art deco-style carved doors (with upper transoms of stained glass in blue, green, yellow, and rose-violet) led to a sitting room and then to the main living room facing the street.  It had an expansive three-coved set of windows with intricately carved frames and magnificent multi-colored glass.  They were surrounded by pillars and domes of plaster reminiscent of a Tolkein hobbit house.  Opposite the windows there had been a huge chest that opened into an altar when the family wanted to pray. The house was not just a work of art, but also an engineering masterpiece.  Gaudi included a large central double shaft that opened all the way from the ground floor to the roof skylights to allow air and light to filter down.  Rooms on upper levels had beautiful, uniquely-shaped stained-glass windows opening onto the central light shaft. Windows on lower floors were larger (to let in more light), while those higher up were smaller (since they were closer to the light source). A series of slats that could be opened or closed to regulate the air flow was installed under each window. The shaft was tiled in blue\u2014darker blue on the highest level and gradually fading to lighter blue on lower floors to make the whole shaft appear to be the same color.  Passing through the family dining room (much like the living room), we found ourselves in a beautiful garden courtyard, with mosaic sculptures, fountains, floors, and walls\u2014all covered with multi-colored broken tile and glass pieces.  The back fa\u00e7ade of the house had wonderful curved balconies with flower pots, grillwork, and a fanciful frieze of colorful flowers and shapes.  Back into the house and up the stairs, we finally reached the attic level with beautiful rib-arched hallways and the rooms used for laundry and storage. Climbing the small spiral staircase, we emerged on the rooftop to find the most spectacular views of the surrounding city and the most breathtaking mosaic sculptures of all.  Each chimney was a fanciful work of art.  There was also a colorful dragon\u2014or at least part of him (the spine and tail) and a beautiful cross.  Exiting through the gift shop, we also got to see a number of original chairs designed by Gaudi.

This review has nothing negative to say about the building itself - the architecture is amazing, and Gaudi truly was a genius. My experience of the building, however, was ruined by the way visitors were managed within the building and the smartguide. I know the building is popular, and for good reason, but when I went (on a winter morning) the building was heaving with visitors and made moving through the space very difficult and actually quite distressing (can't begin to think how it is in summer). I am usually fine with crowds but I found this to be a very anxious experience due to the volume of people in the building. Numbers should be limited for the safety of people and the historic architecture. The audio and visual guide I found to be very strange and quite unnecessary, and actually resulted in a lot of people viewing the building solely through the screen of the phone which defeats the purpose of visiting a place. The screen literally showed you the same view of the room but with furniture in - what was the point? They could have just displayed old photographs. The building is still breathtakingly beautiful without needing to be shown that there was once furniture in it! The audio was pretty useless too and gave you very little historical information (which I would have liked) and instead just told you where to look and when in each room, meaning that everybody ended up looking in the same places and made thoroughfare very congested and the rooms crowded. I understand the motivation behind having a 'smart guide' that allows people to interact with the building but for me having both audio and smartphone combined to make it useless. After Casa Batllo I went to La Pedrera and their audioguide was simple and much more effective, as well as still being 'smart'. Overall, I was extremely disappointed and quite freaked out at the experience of Casa Batllo, and it prevented me from enjoying a building that is rightfully a UNESCO World Heritage site. I can't help but think that if Gaudi could see Casa Batllo now he would be disappointed at how it has become digitised, and monetised, and aims only to make profit off as much footfall as possible. It was like being in a Black Mirror episode.\nI have never written a negative review before and I don't like them, but I felt so strongly about my experience in Casa Batllo that i just had to say something. I am glad that so many people have a lovely experience enough to write a positive review, but next time I know that I will just admire the beauty from the outside.", "publishedDate": "2019-12-27", "language": "en", "rating": 1}, {"id": 734915598, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d191052-r734915598-Casa_Batllo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "There are lots of great details, and lots of beauty.
