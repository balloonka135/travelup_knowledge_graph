(Of course, instruments from the Western areas are in the ascendency but a good chunk of space is also provided for a good collection from the Orient, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and even the Oceanic areas).  \n\n* When I visit Musical Instrument Museums, I always look out for instruments which I have never seen before.  The Museu de la Musica did not disappoint - there were two or three instruments which I had never seen before, much less contemplated before actually seeing them.  \n\n* The layout is logical in terms of chronology as well as categorisation of musical instrumentation type (e.g. Brass vs Strings, 15C versus 19C)\n\n* Very well done was the added accompaniment of instrument and era specific recordings of the instruments in the various areas - nice work!\n\n* Also fascinating (to a music geek like me) was a parallel collection of works/examples showing the development of both how music was recorded and captured for posterity.  Trust me - music was captured a long way before the cassette tape or vinyl records - and this museum really well shows and demonstrates that.  Awesome. \n\n* Equally fascinating was the exhibition showing the development and presentation of how music was written out (working from simple monophonic scores right up to the far out representations on paper required to communicate 21st century compositions.\n\n* The location was handy and central\n\n* The layout was great - a lot was covered in a reasonably sized space.\n\nI will unquestionably visit again in the future.  If you have an interest in music - then I'd recommend this place to your attention should you happen to find yourself in Barcelona.\n\n9/10", "publishedDate": "2016-11-13", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 386791706, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2223604-r386791706-Museu_de_la_Musica-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We visited the museum because it was free and we were nearby.
