Facing the Barcelona Cathedral, as well as the gateway of the Roman Fort structure, icons of major historical periods all come together. For this alone, I think a long pause here is well worth anyone\u2019s time. The Picasso Wall is also a good spot to consider your next destination. Down one direction, past the wall, is Portal de l\u2019Angel, a street full of modern shopping and good eating, that eventually ends at Plaza de Catalunya. Portal de l\u2019Angel feels much more secure than Las Ramblas and offers more variety. If modern shopping is not your thing, turn your back on the Picasso Wall to walk in the opposite direction. You will be facing the remains of the ancient Roman Fort. Walk through the Roman gateway, and you are then in the heart of the Gothic Quarter with the Barcelona Cathedral to your left or, straight ahead, a main walkway (Carrer Bisbe) that accesses the winding maze of the medieval streets. If you\u2019d prefer to see more Picasso, keep straight on Carrer Bisbe until it opens into a large square, the Plaza de Sant Jaume. Turn left onto Carrer Jaume which is soon called Carrer de la Princessa.
