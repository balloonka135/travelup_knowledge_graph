It\u2019s named for Francesc Macia, the president of the shorted lived Catalan Republic, which lasted three days. It sits at the junction of Avinguda Diagonal, Avinguda de Josep Tarradellas and Travessera de Gr\u00e0ci. It\u2019s a busy intersection and not really a public square in the traditional sense. Go for the shops around the roundabout and that it. There no much in the roundabout itself, most grass and while statue of a woman washing her hair.\n\nThe roundabout does seem to be used occasionally for political rallies. It\u2019s okay, but don\u2019t go out of the way to see it.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-14", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 676115128, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d3226916-r676115128-Plaza_Francesc_Macia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Plaza Francesc Macia is basically a very large traffic roundabout. It is called a \"Plaza\", but you would be risking your life trying to get to it from the footpath, a long way away! You would have to avoid the continuously moving traffic. The plaza is named after the Catalan president whose name it bears. He proclaimed Catalonia as the \"Catalan Republic within The Iberian Federation\". This state of affairs, however, only lasted between 14-17 April, 1931. The plaza has plenty of greenery, and a pond in its middle, along with a female sculpture. Around the plaza there are many shops and shopping centres as well as office buildings.", "publishedDate": "2019-05-24", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 606577804, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d3226916-r606577804-Plaza_Francesc_Macia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Frances Macia was President of the Catalan Government in start of 20th century. This intersection on the Avinguda Diognal avenue is named after him. The area is popular for its high end international brand stores, shopping centres and business areas. The entire street comes across as a business district with little to offer the tourist other than modernly designed commercial buildings and expensive shopping. We were told there is a Turo Park near this junction which retains the nostalgia of thirties with a statue of Pau Casals, a famous Catalan musician, at its entrance. However from our bus we missed seeing or stopping by at the same. For the tourist a fleeting glimpse of this square seemed justified.", "publishedDate": "2018-08-14", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 583786263, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d3226916-r583786263-Plaza_Francesc_Macia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This plaza commemorates Francesc Macia, first President of the Catalan Government from 1932/33. It is located at one of the busiest intersections in Barcelona, traffic is continuous. Our hotel was located in one of the streets, Carrer del Comte d\u2019Urgell, that joined this intersection. You can access the centre area but beware of the traffic. It is somewhat overgrown, there is a small pond located there with a bust of a female, named Joventut.  Wonder why the monument to the Pesident is not located here instead of Pla\u00e7a Catalunya?
