It is the oldest district in Barcelona. Many buildings go to the 14th / 15th Century back.\nIn addition to many shops and boutiques, or the Basilica of Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar, in the narrow streets - it is also the place of the Catalan government and the town hall of Barcelona.\nImmerse yourself and let yourself drift in the flair.\n\nA tour with a local tourist guide is a great way to learn part of the history of the district, the buildings, and Barcelona, too. It also offers the advantage of being able to concentrate entirely on the surroundings without having to think about where you are. However, during our tour we had caught a tourist guide, who was a bit too much in love with Catalonia. It was very much about the independence and the Catalans - sometimes really too much - so that you have to come back in a friendly way to the buildings and Barcelona. \n\nThe district - fantastic! \nBeautiful architecture, wonderful buildings and good food\nDepending on how intense you will watch the buildings, go shopping and eating, I think it takes more than 3 hours to stay there.\nAfterwards you can visit the Ramblas.", "publishedDate": "2020-05-30", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 753176608, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d190162-r753176608-Gothic_Quarter_Barri_Gotic-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Great ace to stay in Barcelona had great time lots of interesting shops and fantastic places to eat at every turn.

But you\u2019ll know it if you\u2019re in it because much of the architecture will have that medieval feel to it. There are statues and basilicas and so many cool, narrow alleys. \n\nBe aware that it is a popular area for tourists, so it will always be crowded. And because the streets are narrow that could lead to some frustration. We went in January so it wasn\u2019t too bad but I can imagine a more popular month being a little harder to get around. \n\nExpect a lot of graffiti. Like Rome, it seems to be everywhere. But most of it seems to be more of the artistic variety as opposed to gang markings. Every single roll down metal store front is a canvas (not just in this quarter, but throughout Barcelona) to the point that I wonder if many of these are commissioned.
