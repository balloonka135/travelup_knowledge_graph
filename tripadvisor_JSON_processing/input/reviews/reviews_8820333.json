When we got there we were ready to have nice relaxing time and really excited to see our favourite band as well as discover new ones. \nWe quickly discovered that Magnetic Fields were playing inside the Auditori Rockdelux which was a massive black building outside of the gates of the festival. We asked a steward to make sure we would be able to get in. They didn't know so they sent us to an info point far away from where we were and the Auditori was. \nOnce we got there the girl behind the desk advised us to go quickly to the ticket office to buy (!!!) an additional ticket for this performance because she wasn't sure if there were many left. \nThankfully when we got there we were in time to get 2 tickets for 2 euros each. Although this was a small price, we had already spent 80 euros just for that day and were not happy about having to pay extra on the day without warning. \nAfter going outside of the gates to get into what we thought was the entrance we found that we had to walk all the way back into the site and go through the horrendous ordeal of the 3 point security check.\nThe gig was spectacular and I highly recommend going to see The Magnetic Fields anywhere they play. However, we then discovered that they would be playing a second set the next night for the next half of their show, another surprise to us that wasn't communicated at any point.\nAfter this we went outside to get a much needed drink, only to find that we were charged an extra 2 euros simply for getting them from a man with a cart instead of at the bar, why?\nThe whole thing with Primavera is just horrible in itself- large companies plastering their logos everywhere and stages being named after them in the hope they'll snare a few more consumers. \nThe plastic card you're given on the door is completely unnecessary and a waste of plastic too, and the bar uses tons of plastic cups right by the water which will inevitably blow out and pollute the Balearic sea.\nNeedless to say I won't be going back.", "publishedDate": "2017-06-13", "language": "en", "rating": 2}, {"id": 490739997, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8820333-r490739997-Primavera_Sound_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "My second trip to Primavera Sound and a pleasure to be there again. \n\nEverything is good about the experience, although they could do with more wine bars and grass areas for people to chill. \n\nWell behaved crowds make this a really enjoyable experience and I will definitely return as will my fellow travellers.", "publishedDate": "2017-06-05", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 490490680, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8820333-r490490680-Primavera_Sound_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Great festival, really well set up and organised.

It blew my mind in every way. The location is great- at first it seemed too concrete and industrial for my taste (I've been spoiled by the palm trees and green grass at Coachella for too long!), but as the weekend went on I fell in love with the location. The festival organizers do a great job with it. There are so many stages in separate areas that all have their own atmosphere and charm.  And at sunrise when the sky becomes light over the water it really is spectacular. As was every other aspect of the festival. The sound is hands down the best sound I have heard anywhere. The festival is sponsored by a speaker company and between the massive bass and the clarity of the high end, they create a perfect sound experience.  We opted for VIP tickets and they were worth every extra Euro.  The two main stages have VIP only section that are dead front center. We were ridiculously close for all of the headliner acts without having to camp out for hours.  The people at Primavera were amazing too- so chill and friendly.
