Very modern, clean and Spanish artist show casing American locations on canvas. It was great to walk in and see right away an abstract of NYC. Easy to get in no long lines and free to the public in a great neighborhood with beautiful architecture to explore and photograph. Walking distance to the Port Vell and several tapas restaurants.

The one appealing room contained beautiful paintings of major cities.  The other options were lesser.  The main attraction presented was a series of paintings with plain backgrounds and crescent moons.  As an amateur painter (what do I know, right?),  I couldn't help but want to grab some paint and brushes and add a little dimension and intrigue to these very simplistic paintings.  Truly, I tried to gaze quietly at the paintings, and uhhh feel something?  Isn't that what we're supposed to do?  Nah, didn't work.  I guess I'm a cold hearted conservative.  There was another room, but its contents slipped from my memory.", "publishedDate": "2016-05-26", "language": "en", "rating": 3}]}}]
