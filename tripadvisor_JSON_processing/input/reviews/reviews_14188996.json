This one was constructed in 1952 in order to add some beauty to the area but also to act as a roundabout to regulate the growing traffic passing through this very busy intersection.  It is not easy getting very close to the fountain itself, but you don't really need to. It is best viewed from a safe distance, from across the road. Worth checking out.", "publishedDate": "2019-05-28", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 672079990, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14188996-r672079990-Fuente_Monumental_del_Paseo_de_Gracia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This monumental fountain was installed at the intersection of Gran Via and Passeig de Gracia in 1952 to decorate this popular avenue.", "publishedDate": "2019-05-07", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
