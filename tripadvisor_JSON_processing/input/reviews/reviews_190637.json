When asked \"Why\" he did this... no one seemed to know.

A very successful artist in his own lifetime Miro became an icon of Spanish culture the world over.  Yet his paintings have always been very open to interpretation - and this is where the power of his work lies.  At a superficial level they are beautiful abstractions - many in very large formats.  But he kept returning to themes, explored through his reductionist  style.  This is no better demonstrated by the first painting on the route.  It is a double self portrait completed in two stages.  The first 30 years before the second - and his two styles are laid bare - classical training and pure abstraction.  Understand the journey here and you will become enthralled by Miro.
