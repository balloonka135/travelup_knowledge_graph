It is an amazing but small set up with various local artists. The artists are very friendly and eager to talk about their work. I bought a beautiful piece to remember my Barcelona trip!  There was also a festival going on that same day with giant figures dancing, musicians playing and acrobats.  The Cathedral is open so you can go inside and be amazed.

Met by Alex the chef who took us to this fantastic indoor market to buy ingredients so he could teach us how to cook paella. The market is fascinating. Alex was very passionate about it and told you lots of interesting information. We all walked back to his restaurant where he served us sangria and then taught us how to make the paella. Everyone got involved in the preparation and the cooking and then we ate what we had prepared. Fantastic day out. Very good if you are a foodie.

It is more expensive than the more local market that is not very far from here.  There are loads of food shops including tapas, fresh fruits and vegetables, chocolate coated strawberries, jamon (ham), deep fried items, and more.  It is quite crowded and a good place for pickpockets so be careful where you place your belongings.

Dried tomatoes and other fruits like figs (good for spaghetti and bakery);\n2. Herbs especially saffron (expensive in Asia but cheap in Europe local market; very good for seafood);\n3. Iberico ham (must must buy!! Good for pairing with wine and sweet melon; of course, for paella too).\n\nThere are restaurants and bars inside the market too; using fresh ingredients to cook.

It is basically an outdoor market like many big cities have with food vendors and butchers, wine vendors, sweets, fruits and veggies and all kinds of interesting local fare.  It is compact and crowded so hold on to your belongings - it is an easy place to get pick pocketed.  Take your time and stroll the outside vendors, they are less crowded.  Make a lunch out of it sampling things as you go. I liked the egg vendor who had all kinds of eggs for sale including Emu and Ostrich.  Don't touch - It's not customary to touch things as we often do in the US.  In fact, at grocery stores, there are plastic gloves to wear before squeezing fruit to see if it's ripe.  If you have a kitchen, the seafood looked amazing - the shrimps were whole and huge - lobster, whole fish, crabs etc. Fun place to see how other cultures eat .", "publishedDate": "2017-06-24", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 472746122, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d9582536-r472746122-Mercat_del_Art_de_la_Placa_de_Sant_Josep_Oriol-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Good range of art and styles on offer here,  easy to wander round and no feeling of pressure from sellers.
