The cloister is quite pretty and beautiful with its orange trees and is a peaceful haven from the loud traffic of Calle Arag\u00f3n just outside.  As this is not a major tourist site it is evident that the church needs restoration work and some of the chapels are neglected but it is a fine example of Catalan Gothic architecture and is peaceful respite from the sun and noise of the city.", "publishedDate": "2017-08-03", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 449877153, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d6214229-r449877153-Claustro_E_Iglesia_de_la_Concepcion-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "we found this church while walking back from the Sagrada to Las Ramblas, but the place is worth a visit on its own. Both the main church (from the 1400) and the cloister (from the 1500) are splendid example of Catalan Gothic architecture and are certainly out of place in the new quarter where they are. Little we knew that the Church was actually moved here stone by stone during the 19th century to create a Parish in the growing quarter and to avoid its destruction as the original location near the city walls had become an obstacle to the growth of the municipality. During the Christmas period a splendid nativity in the middle of the garden, made it even more worthwhile by the live roosters and hens in nearby cages (I guess as active participants of the Christmas's eve rooster mass?)", "publishedDate": "2017-01-06", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 414451485, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d6214229-r414451485-Claustro_E_Iglesia_de_la_Concepcion-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The cloister's little garden is very quiet and makes you forget the busy road (Aragon) next to it.
