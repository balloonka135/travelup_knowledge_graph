I asked our guide where do locals shop, and he gave us the address of this street. And trust me..what a surprise it turned out to be.\n\nGreat street. Full of all fashion brands, global as well as local. Starts at Plaza de Cataluniya and just keep on going right till the port...\n\nMust visit.

Just a large block to the East, it does not seem nearly as tourist focused. Here you will find tourists and locals enjoying a scenic walk.

It's full of great shopping brands and Spain is a fantastic fashion place- best brands are the Indetex ones ofcourse (Zara, Stradivarius, Bershka, Pull & Bear were significantly more affordable than than in Asia!)
