It was a building housing the Banco Espanol de Credito, until recent years. Today however it houses different tenants. Despite this, the beauty of the whole structure remains and is definitely worth a visit. In fact we were in the hotel, Iberostar, which is now the owner of the building. The interior is absolutely stunning. The building faces Plaza de Catalunya and this makes it even more of an attractive place to visit.", "publishedDate": "2019-05-25", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 624990102, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8736833-r624990102-Banco_Espanol_de_Credito-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Pla\u00e7a De Catalunya is considered the heart of Barcelona, it's were the old district  ( Gothic Quarter  ) meets the new district ( L'Eixample District ) and you have a great mix of architectural styles and Banco Espanol De Credito ( Banesto ) is one of the gems  in this area.\nOriginally built in 1902 with extensions and redesigns occurring in 1916 and 1942 it's a magnificent building built in the Neoclassical style of architecture ,6 floors high,it's a really photogenic building and blends in beautifully with the grand architecture that abounds around Pla\u00e7a De Catalunya. \nMost definitely well worth seeking out.
