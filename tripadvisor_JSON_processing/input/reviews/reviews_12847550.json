Whereas other Auto museums tend to cater to the upper end automobiles this one has a wide variety of automobiles from the working class, it has very few Spanish made automobiles or motorcycles I didn't see a single Hispano-Suiza or Kapi but I did see lots of french, german and english cars and motorcycles including some brass era vehicles and some turn of the century motorcycles. \nIt was around 10 Euro to get in and covers 3 levels - not sure if elevators were available.", "publishedDate": "2018-11-05", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 630250333, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d12847550-r630250333-Retro_Auto_Moto_Museo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This was a bit hard to find on the map.  Coming through the park to the arc de triumph, go left onto Trafalgar.  When you come across the museum, you are at the back. Looking at the museum, go left around block. It cost \u20ac8 cash or visa.  There are two floors of cars and motorcycles, and the third has motorcycles and motorized bicycles.\nThere are over fifty cars from various European countries, USA, Russia; ranging from 1890s to 1960s..I also liked the easy listening background music.  It as a Sunday morning and at opening.  We were the only one\u2019s in the museum through our stay.  There was a good description on the details of each car in Spanish and English.  On the way out, you get to select a postcard.", "publishedDate": "2018-11-02", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 623600052, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d12847550-r623600052-Retro_Auto_Moto_Museo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The museum hosts vintage cars, motorcycles and bicycles.

It turns out we were on the back-end of Retro Auto Moto Museo, which didn't pop up in any of our Barcelona research. \n\nWe easily found the front entrance to the museum and spent over an hour looking at the well over 100 cars and motorcycles. They were all in very good (not pristine) shape and their origins spanned a wide variety of countries, including the former GDR and Soviet Union. The irony is that there wasn't a single car or motorcycle of Spanish manufacture.\n\nAs we walked through the museum, I thanked my wife profusely for her observant eye, as she knows my passion for antique cars and bikes. And I'm still thanking her as I write this review.", "publishedDate": "2018-10-08", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 607049381, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d12847550-r607049381-Retro_Auto_Moto_Museo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "A highly advisable place to visit to see with kids.

Having made a note of its location I returned the next for a visit during its opening times. \nWhat a wonderful surprise. Despite the slightly shabby outlook once you get inside (and the 8 Euro entrance fee is cheap enough) the museum spreads out over three floors. The two lower levels are dedicated to cars and the top level is given over to motorcycles and motorised bicycles. The selection of vehicles is very comprehensive with many makes of car that I'd never heard of before. \nThe great thing about this museum is that you can get up close to the cars, there're no barriers so if you want a close look at a car's interior you can simply walk up to the cat and take a good look through the window. \nThe Museum also houses a wide selection of auto memorabilia, include a range of old car and motorcycle magazine available to buy. \nThis is a great place to go for any petrolhead in Barcelona.", "publishedDate": "2017-11-05", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
