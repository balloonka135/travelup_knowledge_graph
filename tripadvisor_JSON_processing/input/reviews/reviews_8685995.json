You get those a dime a dozen in Barcelona. Yes it's nice, but if every building with a beautiful fa\u00e7ade gets to have its own entry on TA, no one would be able to see the city map under the gazillions of markers. There is no visiting of the building except from the  C&A downstairs, which is far from a tourist attraction. The building is 30 metres off Pla\u00e7a Catalunya so it's not like you need to commute somewhere to see it. I don't even know why this gets its own entry here.", "publishedDate": "2017-04-11", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 381375981, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8685995-r381375981-Casa_Damians-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I went to buy some shirts and summer clothes and find something interesting at a good price as usually for this German fashion brand.
