No longer trusting the visit Barcelona website we cross-referenced the CosmoCaixa's own site and google to ensure it would be open and had availability for all events.\nWhen we reached the ticket desk we were informed that floor -5 and the planetarium were out of bounds until 3pm (it was half eleven) but that we could enter and visit floors 0, -1 and -2 whilst we waited. We double checked online, this had nit been mentioned ANYWHERE!\nThinking it was a kind gesture, we went in. Floor -2 is EMPTY, except for the Creativity Lab, which was closed.\nFloor -1 is the Science Garden, which can be accessed for free anyway, and the pricey restaurant.\nAt this point, having been looking forward to visiting since we booked our holiday in February, I was in tears.\nWe left through the gift shop, which (when my partner looked at a little something to try and cheer me up) was nothing short of extortion!\nWe have been to science museums around the world, yes it is cheap, but no, it is NOT worth it!!

We ended up walking all the way round the block to the main entrance at the front of the old building when some simple signage could have directed us up to the first floor (maybe I am a bit thick and missed something obvious, but I don\u2019t think so!).\n\nThe ramp that took you down to the basement level and the 30m tall Amazonian tree was lovely.  All the exhibits that were in the lower level were fascinating and well laid out.  I particularly enjoyed the Amazonian rainforest exhibit although the bit that you could actually walk through was a bit disappointing (Aquaterra in Vienna was much better).\n\nUnfortunately, there wasn\u2019t much else that I found interesting.  It was more of a family excursion and, as I have no kids, I think would have felt cheated if I\u2019d made a special visit.  However, it was an add-on to Bellesguard so I wasn\u2019t too disappointed.  It only cost \u20ac3 using our Barcelona Busturistic discount vouchers so it was reasonable value for money.\n\nAs many other reviewers have said, if you have time to spare in Barcelona, it\u2019s worth a visit but if you don\u2019t have much time, spend it elsewhere.\n\nThe cafe was very good value - two delicious cakes and two drinks for \u20ac7.25 - and was certainly worth a visit, if you\u2019re at CosmoCaixa.\n\nWe visited on Saturday 14/10/17 and had no difficulty whatsoever with queues.", "publishedDate": "2017-10-14", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 531800482, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244211-r531800482-CosmoCaixa-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This museum is definitely worth paying a visit.

We were really impressed with the amount of hands on exhibits on this floor, there was absolutely loads to do and we spent around 2 hours on this floor alone - it was definitely educational! \n\nThe rainforest is amazing - there's a glass wall between the main part of the bottom floor and the rainforest which means you can see the different animals swimming around - there's fish, stingrays, crocodile, turtles and capybara's! There's also a door which allows you to walk around and under the rainforest with various viewpoints. It was definitely the highlight of the visit! \n\nThe only reason we did not give it five stars was that the layout initially is very confusing and trying to find the ticket office was a nightmare with the security and ticket barrier staff being less then helpful (please note: the exhibit staff were brilliant).

If you want to do any I would definitely recommend pre-planning as there seemed to be only 1-2 a day of the English activities. \n\nAlthough brilliant for kids, it's also fun for adults. We are a 24 and 25 year old and we had a great time! \n\nThere's a restaurant and picnic area for people planning on coming over lunch. \n\nWe went on a weekday afternoon and it was really quiet. Quite a few school trips were leaving as we were arriving, so I would probably recommend going either early morning or after the schools have finished as I imagine that it can get busy and loud when there are school trips there. \n\n", "publishedDate": "2017-07-23", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 504324967, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244211-r504324967-CosmoCaixa-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I visited the museum in December. There was one other adult couple there and about 300 young school kids on a day trip! But they were mostly playing outside in the large garden area. \nI completely recommend this science museum for families or adults. Take a map so you can find  it, and its not that far from the metro.\nThe entry fee was such good value, it was something like \u20ac4.\nYou enter at the top level and wind your way down through the floors, each with a different theme, before emerging in the central 'rainforest' area (complete with animals, plants and rain!). \nIt was cool and really interesting. There were lots of interactive parts and exhibits. I was surprised there were not more people there, maybe it is aimed more at school trips. There is a restaurant in the outdoor area.", "publishedDate": "2017-07-21", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
