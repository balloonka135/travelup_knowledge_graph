I particularly recommend the dried fruit and nuts at Lagrana and the fantastic fish restaurant attached to Joan Noi.

We bought fresh fruit and ate seafood at the Joan Noi counter.  It was our best meal in Barcelona and most unexpected as we hadn't planned to visit but instead stumbled upon this market on a walk.
