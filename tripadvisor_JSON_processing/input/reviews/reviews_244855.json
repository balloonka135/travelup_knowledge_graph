Being the only visitors there, it was just us, the waxworks and a somewhat eerie silence. There is something quite creepy about being alone in a large hall full of inanimate life like figures, but this provided a different experience to Madame Tussards where when it's busy and with the figures not sectioned off, sometimes you can't tell the difference between them and guests until someone moves and makes you jump!\n            As usual, it's a matter of trying to work out who's who, and we discovered later in the tour that an audio guide was available. The good thing though, with the figures that you aren't familiar with, it does make you curious and want to search up who they are. Most of the figures are also placed in somewhat appropriately fitting scenes, with some more impressive than others including walking through Captain Nemo's submarine.  Understandably, for those who might scare easily, there are parts of the museum that I can imagine people might be apprehensive about walking through as you're not quite sure what might be coming up next, but this might only be heightened when there's not many people about. \n         Overall, a lot of effort has gone into making the figures and trying to match likenesses etc (some are very good, whilst others are not necessarily bang on), but unless a waxworks is your thing I'd say check out the bar La Bosc de Les Fades just along from it instead.

(Or at the very least their names on the wooden plaques.)\n\nThe rooms were split into different themed areas, with lighting effects and mechanical display areas - although some of these could do with a little oil. Some may also be quite frightening for young children. \n\nThe Star Wars themed area was a personal highlight. I have never seen anything as amusing in a museum before. Look out for another character from a separate blockbuster making a strange appearance. \n\nOverall, the museum is far from perfect and holds some 'interesting' interpretations of famous faces. Yet we had a great time here and came out very happy with the experience. \n\nIf you are on a strict budget or want to see quality pieces of wax artwork, this probably isn't the museum for you. \n\nOn the other hand, if you have some euros and time to spare.

The exhibition of Napoleon & his first wife Josephine was also very good where he is shown in his famous hand-in-waistcoat gesture.
