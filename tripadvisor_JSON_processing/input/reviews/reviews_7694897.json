It's the first structure that you notice as you're walking towards Placa del Rei. There's the old Roman wall that is at the base of the Royal Chapel. You will also see the Royal Palace, the house of Clariana-Padell\u00e0s, and the Lieutenant's Palace. The latter one has a beautiful courtyard in the Renaissance style that is lined with grapevines (one of which is over 100 years old). Don't miss seeing Subirachs' bronze door of Sant Jordi on the stairway. I totally missed taking a picture of it, and I regret it already. The square is just full of history. There's even a museum that houses the Roman history of Barcelona. We didn't have enough time to see it, but it's very similar to the El Born Cultural Center. \n\nThe steps seem to be very popular as well. It's a great place to sit down and enjoy the scenery. It's a comfortable area, and the surrounding buildings provide shade from the sun. Don't miss seeing this part of the Gothic quarter.", "publishedDate": "2015-06-06", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 274707601, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7694897-r274707601-Placa_del_Rei-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The Placa is an ordinarily magnificent square in old Barcelona.  The cathedral nearby is not to be missed.  The Palau Rejal Major, which feels like an ambassador's residence, probably IS missed by the vast majority of visitors.  Step inside and look directly up: you'll see one of the most magnificent wooden carved ceilings ever built.  Simply outstanding.
