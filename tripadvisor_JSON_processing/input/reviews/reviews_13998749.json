It is not a very long road, but it is wide, tree-lined, and designed to look majestic.  It is named after Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, a queen consort of Spain from 1829 to 1833, and regent of Spain from 1833 to 1840. At its entry point from Plaza d'Espanya, there are two tall red brick towers, called Venetian Towers, because they were modelled on the campanile of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. Another important aspect  is that the Barcelona Marathon starts at this spot! The road also leads to the \"Magic Fountain\", just further up the hill, and a bit further up is the Art Museum. The road looks particularly majestic if you look at it from a height, and one of the best spots is the top floor of Arenas de Barcelona Shopping Mall, just across the road from Plaza d'Espanya, opposite the Venetian Towers. This is a beautiful area to visit, particularly in the evening when the Magic Fountain show is on.
