The meanings of the Muses around the stage, the symbolism in the architecture, how everything comes together to suggest the universality of music, the common bond yet also meeting in the centre with Catalan heritage.

This concert was a joint effort of the Symphony Orchestra of the Valleys and the Youth Choir of Orfeo Catala.  \n\nThe Palace of Catalan Music was built between 1905 and 1908.  While it was restored in the 1980's it is still one of the strangest concert hall I have been in.  It has windows on both sides of the hall.  We walked up but found an elevator to ride down.  It is a very large concert hall and most all the seats were filled.  \n\nThe program was the Egmont Overture, Cantata in the death of Emperor Joseph II, and the Fifth Symphony.\n\nThe Cantata was a huge work, five movements.  There were four soloists and a big choir.\n\nI don't think the orchestra was particularly good.  One oddity was the extreme display of exertion by the concertmaster, a blonde women.  I was worried that she was going to get whiplash.  \n\nThis is the second time I have heard the Fifth Symphony in Barcelona.  Both times I noted the languid pace.  To me, Beethoven's music is in your face.  If one does not feel pushed then something is missing.  \n\nAfter the concert we walked back to the hotel but the street was taken up by a huge block party.  There were trucks spewing fireworks in the air and there was a thousand snare drums playing.  Teresa talked to some policemen who said it was a week-long, city-wide party.  As we wound our way back to the hotel we stopped for xiao lung bao, our tapas for the night.", "publishedDate": "2019-10-30", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 722672127, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d190824-r722672127-Palace_of_Catalan_Music-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Despite warnings of protest, police precedence, we powered through to a packed house and enjoyed a most amazing cultural event.
