Would gladly pay it again. (6 or 8\u20ac?)\n\nFacilities: bathroom, lockers to store your bags (small), souvenir shop\n\nTime: I spent 70 minutes and had to leave at closing. I could have done 2.5 hours easy but for a typical museum visitor I would set aside 90 minutes.\n\nThe museum is set up as a timeline, beginning with the origins of sports and competition. The chronological set up makes it easy to follow the development of sports as part of entertainment and culture in different regions.\n\nMemorabilia and descriptions from many countries and disciplines are presented spanning decades. While there is a focus on Olympic sports, it seems any kind of physical activity is covered (snowshoeing, mountain climbing, dune buggy racing).\n\nI was too young to experience the Barcelona Olympics but after seeing this museum I feel like I did. Pieces of opening ceremony costumes, advertisements, newspapers, torches, mascots, game used uniforms/kits... Beautiful presentation.\n\nInteractive areas: Use the database to find athletes of past Olympics. Watch videos of historic moments. Go through the \u201cathletic feats\u201d type assessment to test speed and reflex. You can spend a lot of time on these.\n\nThis place is worth the walk/ride/drive/hitch from Barcelona\u2019s center, I promise! Afterwards, visit the stadium and keep your eyes on the sidewalk to see the footsteps of some of the sports worlds greatest.", "publishedDate": "2019-12-20", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 723224693, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2223655-r723224693-Joan_Antonio_Samaranch_Olympic_Sports_Museum-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Incorporated into our walk of the Montjuic area.

We were walking through the public gardens of Parc de Montju\u00efc when my daughter decided she really had to go to the restroom.  Unfortunately, the nearest public toilet was out of order.  We were planning on walking around the Olympic stadium and had time to kill, so the Museum seemed like a good place to both take care of an urgent problem and have a bit of fun.  And it didn't cost a ton.\n\nOnce inside, we found (a bathroom) a ramp leading down to the lower floors lined with exhibits telling the story of sports with mini-exhibits explaining a variety winter and summer Olympic events.  The exhibits typically consist of a picture or two of athletes performing the task and then a piece or two of equipment with a little bit of text next to it (in English).  Seeing and touching a bobsled from the 1970's and an Indy car mounted on a wall were highlights.  \n\nOnce we reach the ground floor, you get to the exhibits more focused on the Olympics and the Barcelona games specifically.  There are a bank of video monitors that can be used to see highlights of previous Olympic games.  Here, my favorite sites was a line-up of Olympic torches from decades of Olympic games.  These things are amazing works of design artistry.  I also enjoyed Salvador Dali's half hearted letter of support for the games to come to Barcelona.  \n\nAll in all the kids seemed to not mind this as much as a typical museum and my wife and appreciated the simplicity of a relaxing, low impact, and straightforward history lesson.

There are lots of high tech video screens and some interactive stuff, but it seems a bit of a sad almost forgotten ghost museum.

It is a little confusing and as a sports fan I found some of the choices of sports to put in the spotlight were poor, and some of the people shown as very important for each sport were only important inside Spain and not so important in the world context. Also the history of the Olympic movement could have been put in another way, there are some big time lapses in the history and some of the most important (even if sad moments) are not present / are not show as much as I feel they should. Then there is a zone dedicated only to sports in Catalonia, witch is cool but feels a little of an ego trip for the Catalan people. This part is ok, but not amazing.\n\nAfter this comes the best part: one zone with a lot of Olympic torches, some important trophies, and the personal collection of Joan Antonio Samaranch, with a lot of things he collected during his life. Some are not very interesting, but some are really really cool if you are into the Olympic games. There is also a big section only about the 92 games, and it is also amazing, with a lot of things from 92 and  the history of this game explained in detail. This part alone was worth the ticket me.

I had been on hop on hop off bus tour that stopped over in Port Olympico and I had declared to my family that there was no way I would leave Barcelona without seeing this museum so they knew that seeing it was a must. \n\nWhat I saw once inside took my breath away. It was amazing to see the many artifacts that have defined not just the Olympic Games but also the world of sport as a whole. Everything in the museum tells a story and this museum tells the story of how the Olympic games have evolved over the years from the many technological advances to the people that have defined the creation and continued evolution of the games. \n\nMost moving where video displays of several of the greatest moments in Olympic history and the display of torches from the first Olympic Games to the return of the Winter Games to my home country of Canada in 2010 and seeing the Vancouver torch on proud display made me relive my experience of being a firsthand witness to those games having personally attended the opening ceremony along with a speedskating and women's hockey event. It's too bad that I was a bit pressed for time- I could have easily spent the entire day just soaking up the incredible artifacts, history and stories inside of the Juan Antonio Samaranch Olympic and Sports Museum. \n\nThis museum while it may be somewhat small in terms of it's physical size is a place that captivates, inspires and educates. It did that with me on my visit to Barcelona and I hope it remains forever so that it may do the same for an entirely new generation of visitors.", "publishedDate": "2015-01-19", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 239548634, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2223655-r239548634-Joan_Antonio_Samaranch_Olympic_Sports_Museum-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "There are a few things of interest, but overall, we were disappointed and felt like we wasted our time and money on a museum of generic Olympic history.", "publishedDate": "2014-11-12", "language": "en", "rating": 2}, {"id": 238689594, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2223655-r238689594-Joan_Antonio_Samaranch_Olympic_Sports_Museum-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I have always loved the Olympic Games.\n\nThe museum is an embarrassment to its ideals.\nThis display receptacles are over crowded and some even incorrectly labelled.\nBadly light.\nPoor signage\n\nBasement is shrine like- to the man who brought the Games to the city.\nI found it offensive to be in an Olympic museum\u2026let him pay for his own catacomb of memorabilia ..I wanted a refund I was that annoyed.\n\nI wouldn't bother with this or the stadium.\nBoth major disappointments.", "publishedDate": "2014-11-07", "language": "en", "rating": 2}, {"id": 234356184, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2223655-r234356184-Joan_Antonio_Samaranch_Olympic_Sports_Museum-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Lovely wee museum at the Olympic Park on Montjuic.

The final parts involves a archive of Samaranch's collections and his personal involvement in the IOC.\n\nOverall it was a interesting overview of the Olympics, and make me quite sad that the London Olympic Organising Committee has cancelled its plans to open a similar museum.
