It's a hidden gem.\n\nIts a lovely park with many species of plants and flowers. If you make it to the top, the views over Barcelona are absolutely spectacular. \n\nBut the best thing about this place? the complete lack of people. When I visited I saw one other person in the park. There was no-one there to ruin the peace and quiet, and I was free to enjoy the amazing views in peace.", "publishedDate": "2016-03-17", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 341145806, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7735950-r341145806-Jardines_del_Turo_del_Putxet-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Situated on the slopes of the Putxet Hill, these beautiful gardens offer a stunning number of various species, some of them quite rare, and amazing views on the city.
