We made a trip across the city one evening specifically to visit it.  The selection was good, but I'd hoped for a larger section of Spanish or Catalan history.  I imagine that their main clientele consists of expats, but they get enough tourists in the shop that they had a separate section for travel guides to Spain and Spanish language learning.  Perhaps history just isn't as popular. \n\nI'd also hoped for a little more friendliness from the staff.  The person behind the counter barely looked up when we came in, didn't say a word to us the whole time we were in the shop, and could hardly be bothered to tell me the total when I did end up purchasing a book.

Next thing.... the shop worker asks me to wait while he made several DO NOT TOUCH signs.

The owner gives off the impression that you are an inconvenience, including in some posts they put on facebook, speaks to you in Catalan (which I can speak and understand but I am English and we are in an English bookshop for goodness sakes) and grunts a hello at you only after you say hello to him.
