First the building is a fantastic mix of Neo-Classical, Baroque and Catalan Modernism. The interiors are sumptuous and adorned with beautiful decorations as befit a palace originally intended for a queen.\n\nAs for the tour, it was great. The guide gave us a lot of history of the building, how the parliament works and even got a tour of the session chambers where I got to sit in the seat reserved for the President of Catalonia. Wonderful.\n\nTo the tour guide who gave the tour in English, thanks, you were great.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-18", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 633158110, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10093192-r633158110-Parlament_de_Catalunya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We took a guided tour.  The guide was lovely but her English was halting.  Instead of focusing on the building, we were subjected to a political discussion.

While other parliament buildings are huge, appear Romenesque and overpower their location to show their importance, this one is like a country palace (see pics) decorated for its time with glorious hand-carved wooden and metal doors (see pic).\n\nThe archways are wonderful (see pic) as well as the painted patterns on the walls (see pic).  The bricks used are such a big feature of the pretty design, as are the wooden window shutters and romantic balconies (see pic).  Speaking of romance, a place that encourages couples to sit and enjoy the view is the pond in front of the parliament building, with a sculpture of a desperately sad woman in the middle (see pic).", "publishedDate": "2018-03-08", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 558648644, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10093192-r558648644-Parlament_de_Catalunya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "While this was a lovely building in the tranquil park, there were no tours available during our visit, so we could only enjoy the lovely building's exterior.", "publishedDate": "2018-02-05", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 381332700, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10093192-r381332700-Parlament_de_Catalunya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I visit Barca more than once and today I see this place, with the amazing fountain and forest like atmosphere, I think I will visit it a lot, thank you Barcelona ", "publishedDate": "2016-06-10", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
