However, given the informative nature of the exhibition, the communication is done terribly. The image descriptions look like a puzzle and it takes much time to figure out which description belongs to which image. Such images are not always observed for their artistic beauty, but rather for the information they transmit, therefore it is important to make sure that this information is given to the visitors in a better way rather than sticking an A4 paper on the wall which tells about 15 photos at once.
