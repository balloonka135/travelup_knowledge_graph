The instructor was speaking really good English , he explained all details very thoroughly for me to understand. I've never had experience with scuba diving before. He was reassuring every step of mine, and he was extra cautious. He taught me how to breathe underwater with all the equipment. He took me into the tank with the fish, while I followed his instructions completely. We did two rounds in the tank, while he was holding me all the time, I never felt scared. All animals were near us but he was moving me around, so I didn't have to make any effort but breathing. It was a great experience for me. Ideal even for kids. They provide everything . Towels, diving suits, fins, shoes , ofc all the proper scuba diving equipment. I left the aquarium with the best feelings, impressions and memories. Pricelist can be found on the aquarium's site.

The actual experience of being able to dive with the sharks was incredible though! The instructor was very kind and helpful even though I don't speak much Spanish (my bad!).

The stingrays and sharks all swam right by the cage and the instructor takes you out in the open water one by one and swims you be all the sharks, It was awesome and I can't wait to do it again.
