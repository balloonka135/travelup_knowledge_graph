The setup was very impressive. I had no trouble wearing glasses with the headset and got to start playing really easily. The games were a lot of fun and you could even move around a bit and the sensors picked it up!  They were very immersive and the scores gave it an interesting competitive component.\nThe staff was really helpful and patient and they made it all feel really easy. It was also nice to see that they cleaned and disinfected the headsets between each use.", "publishedDate": "2020-03-02", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 748499471, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d15668683-r748499471-JuegaRV_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Very good Vr place with different games.
