The Gardens are quite large with numerous features. There are several landscaped terraces, many trees, bushes, and a wide range of plants and flowers, as well as statues, fountains and a variety of other water features. It is a really beautiful environment to be in and have a wonderful experience. We walked through the gardens for quite some time and loved being \"lost\" in the lovely wilderness. We did not see too many other people around, but we did not mind that at all. At the beginning of the last century, the area used to be a venue for public and private meetings. Most of the area occupied by the gardens used to belong to a famous lawyer, by the name Josep Laribal, after whom the gardens are named. This is an exceptional environment in Barcelona and we would highly recommend a visit.", "publishedDate": "2019-05-17", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 648329545, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8866286-r648329545-Jardins_de_Laribal-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Just visited the garden de Laribal with my wife and daughter. The location is very tranquil but BEWARE.\n\nAs we were exiting a shady couple sprayed some liquid on my wife and daughters hair and clothes.  They pointed to the sky and said it was birds.  They commenced cleaning my wife\u2019s hair and daughters jacket then suddenly the man started cleaning liquid off my trouser.  The lady gave me tissues and said \u201cquick quick clean your wife\u2019s hair\u201d.  The man started pushing my wallet out of my pocket as though he was cleaning my trouser leg. At this stage I got suspicious and started pushing the wallet back and thanked them and looked at their faces.

They really don't look like they are maintained or cleaned. There was no toilet roll in the male or female rooms and the flush in the female toilets didn't work. The men's toilets had no lighting at all. Honestly, if I were here again I'd settle for a bush, it would be more hygienic.
