So you\u2019ll probably come to this at some point anyway if you\u2019re canvassing the area so you might as well look around. It\u2019s worth a few minutes to walk the circle. \n\nA word of warning is that just like Las Ramblas, you\u2019re exposure to pickpockets and people selling drugs is higher here. This is simply because it\u2019s very crowded with tourists. We found that stuff easy to deal with. Keep your distance from everyone, don\u2019t give someone who tries to stop you even a moments hesitation, and if anyone approaches you, move away. I didn\u2019t find any of these guys aggressive; whatever they say or offer don\u2019t slow down, mutter a no or no thank you and continue and you\u2019ll be okay. Be vigilant is the key. Once in a while that may not be enough because of a rare super street criminal but that is anywhere. Honestly, you should be aware and vigilant like this in any big city square (or circle).

We went to all the major tourist attractions but invariably returned to Plaza de Cataluna at least once a day because, in our opinion, it is the all-inclusive destination in Barcelona. To illustrate, there was a taxicab strike during our stay.  The taxicab drivers chose Plaza de Cataluna as the place to assemble in protest.  Likewise, thousands of Venezuelans marched in protest to Madura which culminated at Plaza de Cataluna.  If, you want to experience the unmatched vibrancy of Barcelona, go to Plaza de Cataluna.
