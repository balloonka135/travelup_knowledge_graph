The museum opened in March, 2011. The museum is installed in a building designed by the Modernist architect Enric Sagnier in 1904. When we entered the museum we found that it had two floors with a space of 1000 square meters. At once we were overwhelmed by the art we found in the museum, Modernist art at its best. On the ground floor there was the furniture section with furniture designed by Gaudi, Gaspar Homar and Joan Busquets. There was furniture that used the art of marquetry, many using 40 different types of wood. The marquetry designs on the furniture looked like paintings, because so many types of wood were used, each with its own color. There were beautiful mirrors with spectacular designs. The furniture included cabinets, dining tables, and office furniture, all looking like art objects. The furniture designed by Gaudi was meant to be used at Casa Mila, Casa Battlo, and Casa Calvet.\nDownstairs was the section of painting and sculpture with work by Ramon Casas, Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol, Joaquim Mir, Josep Limona and Eusebi Arnau. Arnau was a sculptor who worked on the decoration of the wonderful Palau de la Musica and the Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau. There were stained glass panels created by Maumejean that were spectacular. Joaquim Mir created a trio of stained glass panels with flowers and wildlife that were simply beautiful. Antoni Rigalt I Blanch has two stained glass panels, one of the Virgin of Montserrat and another of Sant Jordi. This is the only museum dedicated solely to  Catalan Modernism. There are more than 350 works of art designed by 42 artists.", "publishedDate": "2011-11-02", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
