Today, this bullring is only a museum with some limited areas within the bullring opened to the public.

But our patience was rewarded. \n\nThere were 2 gentlemen who were on the gate, one of whom very proudly took us through to the museum and unlocked the doors for us. He explained in Spanish how he was part of the family, pointing to a photo from 1948 which had someone looking almost identical to him standing by a matador. He was clearly very proud of his links with the history. \n\nAnd then we just wandered around! Looking at the costumes through the ages, and the posters and the heads of some of the famous bulls.\n\nBut hold your breath for entering the ring! Its a huge amphitheater with raked seats all around. Close your eyes and listen to the noise of the crowd, the racing hooves of the bulls. Climb to the top of the seating and look down and its amazing. But perhaps be thankful that the bloodshed doesn't happen still. \n\nThis place is not well known, it seems on the tourist trail, and there are apparently discussions to turn it into a mosque. Don't expect a slick museum with lots of multimedia - this is a raw travel experience. So our advice is find it whilst you can, pay the 6 euros entrance, explore and listen to the stories.
