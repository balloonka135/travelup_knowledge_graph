The Basilica de la Mare De D\u00e9u De La Merc\u00e8 (Basilica of Our Lady of Mercy) is a Baroque-style basilica in Barcelona. It is unique in the ecclesiastical history of Barcelona because it is a Minor Basilica (the second to receive this title in Barcelona), it is the Mother Church of a medieval religious order, houses the statue of the patron Virgin of Barcelona, and contains the remains of another parish \u2013 Saint Michael the Archangel.\n\nThe story goes on the evening of August 1, 1218, the Blessed Virgin appeared to three men \u2013 St. Peter Nolasco, St. Raymond, and King Jaume I \u2013 and asked them to found an order (Order of Mercy) to provide for the Christians who were being taken into captivity by Muslim pirates and forcibly converted. The Mercedarians, in addition to vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience also promised to exchange themselves in ransom for another Christian who was in danger of losing his faith.\n\nIn 1637, the people of Barcelona gathered at this church to pray to the 14th-century statue of Our Lady of Mercy, a wooden sculpture of the Virgin and Child, for her intervention in stopping a plague of locusts. When this occurred, by popular decree of the city council she became an unofficial patroness of the city. Blessed Pius IX formally recognized her as the city\u2019s patroness in 1868, and it became an official local government holiday in 1871.\n\nWe spent less than 30 minutes poking around this beautiful old church. I wouldn't have gone out of my way to see it, but it was worth stumbling upon.", "publishedDate": "2016-02-19", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 347325890, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d591146-r347325890-Basilica_of_Our_Lady_of_Mercy-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Wonderful church.

We were just admiring it from the exterior when a gentleman invited us in.  Many locals were there praying in observance of the Holy Day.  As a Catholic myself it was so beatiful to see the devotion and care that those that take care of this Basilica have.  \nThey accept donations but also sell small items from booklets on the Saint as well as religions medals and rosaries.  No big gift shop with tons of staff,  just a very friendly Catalonian gentleman who doesn't speak English but you can tell loves his Basilica.  Rosaries are affordable and good quality.

Out comes manymkenmdressed as devils or in dragon floats, etc. They light spinng fire works and run thru the crowds of tens of thousands.  We chose to participate and ran and jumped with the fire runners. Our cloths were scotched and the screen on my Samsung phone took a hit from a fireworks and cracked, but the videos and memories we take with us is amazing.\n\nThe festival is done annually. We will return. Barcelona and Catalonia is incredible, super friendly and something for everyone. No issue with pickpockets, use common sense. Eat off the tourist paths.

I can't begin to understand how he could create so much beauty and originality...For decades they thought it was Sand colored but when the totally and to an amazing stand restored the interior it turned out to be almost white...the famous Sand Castle exterior is partly cleaned and is also nearly white. You will wonder what makes it stand up...it looks fragile and you would think it would fall down it is so delicate...Take a lot of time to see it....take a tour as they get in...in groups...the walk in line is wrapped around the block and could take hours to get inside (which is a must) Stain glass mostly restored...so amazing and so modern...breathtaking.
