The cathedral and cloisters entrances are free (between 8am-12:45pm and 5:15pm-8pm, weekdays\u2014slightly altered times on weekends), but the museum can only be accessed with a \u201cDonation Fee\u201d of 7 Euros (1pm to 5pm, weekdays\u2014slightly altered times on weekends), which also includes entrance to the choir, the roof, and the Saint Christ of Lepanto\u2019s Chapel. The Museum is very tiny, housed in the old Chapter Hall, which is accessed off the cloisters. It consists of three small spaces: 1) the entrance area with a few paintings, 2) an inner room with mostly religious treasures such as a gold and silver monstrance that since the mid-15th century has sat on the equally opulent 14th-century throne of King Martin, and 3) a narrow side room, which was the Chapter Hall where the cathedral\u2019s religious order would meet for discussion; this room still retains the architectural seats and holds paintings and wall murals (or tapestries\u2014my memory is fuzzy in regards to this room; it was a busy day of touring!). If you want to visit all the included entrances, then the 7 Euros is worth the money, but the museum alone is too small to account for that fee, unless your area of expertise or interest is in medieval church art and history.
