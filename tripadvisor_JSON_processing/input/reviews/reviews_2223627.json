To this original part a further wing was added in the mid-thirties of the sixteenth century, the style of this one being renaissance. It lies close to the Barcelona Cathedral.\nThe permanent exhibition consists in a collection of very interesting religious items having formerly been in some of the Barcelona parish churches and which were transferred to that Museum. There one can admire some real masterpieces in different styles and therefore from different historical periods. Among them, the mural paintings by Poliny\u00e0 dating back to the 12th century, the carving of the Virgin of St. Mary de Toudell and the silver romanesque cross by Riells del Fai are outstanding.\nIn the permanent exhibition there are also objects created by the worldwide famous architect Gaudi, that one who designed extraordinarily revolutionary buildings such as the \u201cSagrada Familia\u201d or \u201cLa Pedrera\u201d. No doubt the observation of such objects helps visitors to understand the architect's creativity and the reason why he became the universal genious that he was. Among those items one can see a musical lectern and a door handle. His drawing box is also exhibited there.\nIn addition to the permanent exhibition in some rooms of the Museum concerned there is a temporary exhibition. On the day I visited that Museum this consisted in an African art collection showing the socio-religious relationship established by the missionaries of the Barcelona Diocese with the different cultures of the people in Africa. By observing the relevant items it's possible to understand how the African art had an impact on the Western art.\nThe Diocesan Museum in question is a recommendable place to visit since through a careful observation of the items concerned one may acquire some knowledge on Catalan art history, particularly in the religious field. Consequently it's advisable not to miss it while in Barcelona.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-12", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 666222368, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2223627-r666222368-Museu_Diocesa_de_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We viewed this special exhibit the day before going to Sagrada Famila.

The audioguide is most helpful and, if there is one in your native language, you will want 2-3 hours to make the most of this museum; comments here about only needing a short amount of time were mainly published before they updated the exhibition. They have cleverly integrated the religious relics which clearly used to be the main focus into an absorbing and informative display over several floors, now mainly about Gaudi.

Previous comments are obsolete.    \nThe museum was a surprisingly great experience i had with my kids (7+4 years) - unplanned. A charming receptionist explained TO THE KIDS what they can see in the museum, that they will have audioguides, what they will learn. that was already a surprisingly nice start for a museum visit. The kids \u00b4paid no entrance, I got the RESIDENT discount. \n\nEACH one, including each kid got an audioguide (headphones with a Samsung smart phone with the audioguide as an app.) several languages (we used Catalan, Spanish and German). Really easy to handle and well made. - interesting information and well spoken. Some stations are synchronised with videos in the exhibition. Some numbers refer to a complete room and not only to single objects, which makes it quite easy to stroll around and observe while listening. \n\nWe have been impressed by the MODEL CONSTRUCTIONS on the upper floor. and even more when we learned that it is THANKS TO AUSTRIAN RESEARCHERS AND SPONSORS (Univeristy Innsbruck, \u00d6sterreichische Nationalbank...) that original plans and models of the Church and Crypta of the Colonia G\u00fcell had been preserved and resconstructed with latest technology.\n\nFor visitors who haven`t got the chance to visit the original Cryptra at the Colonia G\u00faell, I recommend to pay the small extra for the Virtual Reality visit. \n\nAll in all, we spent more than 1,5h in this museum.
