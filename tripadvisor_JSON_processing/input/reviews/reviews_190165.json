Besides the building, this is a must visit for Picasso fan, art enthusiast or just curioso like me who wanted to know more about once of the most influencing artist in 20th century. The collections is massive, showcasing Picasso life, and changes in his artistic view over the year chronically. The museum also allowed photo taking with a flash so it was good for memory. I especially enjoy the display of his works during his teens (14 years old! - such talent!); his blue paintings and the last part - conceptualization of his Las Meninas from the same by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.

Everyone knows what a Picasso painting looks like but what is far more interesting is his early work from when he was 15. \n\nHis early work is in a classic portrait style where Picasso is learning his craft. Even at an early age he was extremely talented. Interestingly there is no indication at all of the artistic genius that Picasso was to become. \n\nIt does take a bit to get your head around the sudden, left field turn in his art. \n\nA word of caution.

Hence Pablo Picasso spent his formative teenage\u00a0years in Barcelona, this Museu Picasso boasts the world's largest collection of his early art. This museum enabled me to trace the evolution of Picasso's works right back to when he was 10 years old, as he had already revealed his remarkable\u00a0artistic genius.\u00a0\nHis earliest art was realistic and serious and no one would not be impressed with his skilful technique and psychological\u00a0insight. When he was 15 years old, he entered art-school competitions with his breathtaking debut work \"The First Communion\". At art-school, he painted a number of powerful family portraits which had shown his techniques in painting expression and human anatomy.\u00a0\nIn his early 20s, he moved to Paris and his style had changed accordingly. His paintings showed he had followed the styles from a number of artists, such as Monet, Toulouse-Lautrec, Cezanne and Henri Matisse...etc. After the death of his best friend and his own poverty, it led Picasso to enter his Blue Period and as a result, he produced a series of \"blue paintings\" to match his mood. He started to paint not what he saw but what he felt. Later, Picasso came out from his blues and entered a period of innovative and prolific career by painting colourful and world-famous freed arts!\nWhat I liked the most about this museum was it help me to discover his life through his paintings. Here below are some of his most famous collections at this museum:\n1) Home amb boina (man in a beret): One of his paintings of the portraits of an old man in his village. (Pablo was only 13 years old when he painted this)\n2) First Communion: Pablo's incredible debut work when he entered his art-school competitions at the age of 15 years old. (It's actually a portrait of his dad and his sister)\n3) Pablo's self-portrait: You'd be amazed by how he saw himself when he painted his self-portrait!\n4) L'Espera (Margot): Picasso's Margot was an evocative painting portraying a call girl whilst she was waiting for her customer.\n5) Las Meninas Series: Based on the Velazquez painting Las Meninas, Picasso had created a series of Vas Meninas colourful paintings.\n6) Science and Charity: He painted this when he was still a teenager. The doctor was Pablo's father, represents science. the nun represents charity and religion, as she was helplessly looking at the poor patient and showing death was inevitable.\n7) Home Assegnt: One of Picasso's series of analytic cube paintings\n8) The Blue painting series: Picasso's famous series paintings during his Blue Period.\n9) The pigeon canvases: Picasso's paintings in his 80s.\n\nWe visited the museum on a Sunday late afternoon. There weren't many visitors there but maybe it was due to the poor weather on that day. We had a very good time there and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to witness the early paintings from possibly the most famous painter in 20th century.\nTips:\nDue to the lack of directions signs, the ticket office was very hard to find. We were queuing at 2 wrong places before we found the right queue.

This is the star of the show and if you have come from or are going to Madrid go and see Velasquez's original in the Prado.\nThis is a lovely museum operating with a timed entrance, but once inside it doesn't feel crowded and you are not herded around.\nSo, back to my friend...she admitted to now liking some of the early work - \"Science and Charity\" is here - but still believed that his abstraction could have been done by anybody.
