This has been one of the most important buildings in Barcelona since the 14th Century.\n\nThe original structure was finished in 1392, and the \"Sal\u00f3n de Contraciones\" provides a breathtaking view of medieval gothic architecture that has been protected from the elements and so reveals incredible details.  The neoclassical fa\u00e7ade and addition were commissioned in 1771, and provides a duality that is nothing short of stunning.\n\nThe building is truly still alive.  Within the \"Sal\u00f3n de C\u00f3nsuls\" on the 2nd Floor, the Barcelona Commodities Exchange (3rd largest in the world, after Chicago and Paris) conducts business every Tuesday.  Deals are closed with a handshake.  The Sal\u00f3n Lucrecia, the Sal\u00f3n Dorado and the Escalera de Honor all add to the majesty of this structure.\n\nWe contracted a local tour guide with a thorough knowledge of the history and splendor of the building - it really added to the experience!  Our tour guide explained that It has only been open to the public for two years, and that pre-teens must be carefully supervised.  \n\nTruly worth a visit!", "publishedDate": "2018-06-30", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 584356056, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4597443-r584356056-Casa_de_La_Llotja-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This is a classic Gothic building near the waterfront built in th 14th century and has been involved in commerce and commodities trade ever since.It is now th head quarters  of the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce.", "publishedDate": "2018-06-01", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 505266782, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4597443-r505266782-Casa_de_La_Llotja-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "La Llotha is not the post office as some have posted and included pictures, it is a commodities exchange since medieval times.
