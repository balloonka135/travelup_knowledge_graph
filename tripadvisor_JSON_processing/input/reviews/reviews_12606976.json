Highly recommend to book tickets online. We booked the tickets for entrance and the guided tour, but we should have just gone with the audioguide.

As it was, we were running a bit behind time and he had to rush the end part. \n\nAdditionally, I didn\u2019t quite appreciate his references to the \u201ccreepy family\u201d being the Holy Family (La Sagrada Familia literally translates to the Sacred (or Holy) Family). It kind of took away from the experience of being there at this amazing work which was Gaudi\u2019s life\u2019s work, and he was also reputed to be quite religious, so he probably wouldn\u2019t have appreciated the \u201ccreepy family\u201d references either.

That\u2019s when my love affair began with La Sagrada Familia. I remember the first time I saw the building as we walked up the street from our hotel. I was mesmerized by the quirky intricate details of the building but amazed that the basilica was still being constructed. At that time the exterior wasn\u2019t under scaffolding so we got to really see the details of the exterior and the 2 facades of the resurrection and passion. The interior was under major construction and I distinctly remember touring the main portion of the basilica, the floor of the basilica was dirt and the workmen were sculpting large bunches of grapes. It was hard to imagine what this space would look like when it was complete.\nFast forward to our next visit and this time our visit was much different from the first time in 2008. As we made the same walk from our hotel to the Basilica, we noticed a dramatically different building that was covered with scaffolding. I still got the same magical feeling that I was about to see this amazing structure but in a very different way. We purchased our tickets and stood in line as we waiting to see the interior of the Basilica. As we entered the basilica, I got a small glimmer of color light as we entered and then a flood of multi colored lights that flooded in from the most break taking stain glass windows. The interior of the Basilica was just being finished and all I can say to describe it is Breath Taking!! The once dirt floor that we saw in 2008 had been replaced with beautiful marble flooring that lead you into a room of souring columns that took your eye up to the ceiling that was flooded with the most amazing mix of color from the stain glass windows. The photo that I attached is taken from the floor of the Basilica looking up to the top. On our first trip in 2008, the tours were closed to the public and we weren\u2019t able to go up but this time we were able to get into the towers. This is a MUST DO if you want to see the Basilica from all aspects. It can be a little cloister-phobic at times and you get dizzy going around and around the spiral stairs but it\u2019s so worth it!! Take the time to go up in the towers!!\n\nI can\u2019t wait until my next trip to Barcelona to see what surprises this amazing structure has to unveil!!
