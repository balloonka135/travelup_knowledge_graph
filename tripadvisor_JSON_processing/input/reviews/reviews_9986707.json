The rest were in Spanish. We were handed audio headsets and had to follow the guide walking around with the rest of the Spanish group (about 12 people). The guide did not bother at all to give any explanations in English. Didn't even bother to check on us or to tell us any details in regards to the place. And it was extremely difficult to listen to the English audio when the guide was talking away in Spanish. He was clearly giving more explanations about the place, which was a shame, because we couldn't enjoy the historical beauty of the place. A shame and a total waste of time. Do the guided walking tours of Barcelona instead. This was a really bad experience.", "publishedDate": "2019-02-03", "language": "en", "rating": 1}, {"id": 274713519, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d9986707-r274713519-Anfiteatro_Anatomico-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Modern medicine is mostly business these days....but back in the day, dissections and operations were the featured attraction of amazing shows and were conducted in surroundings designed for beauty and showmanship.
