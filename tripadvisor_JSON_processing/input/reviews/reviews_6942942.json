We spent a few minutes sitting in the shade of the street trees and admired the church\u2019s beautiful appearance. The sculptured entrance and the church\u2019s spires were particularly appealing.\nIf you are visiting the Basilica of the Sagrada Familia, then why not takes a walk along a few blocks and have a look at this classical, beautiful church.", "publishedDate": "2015-10-08", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
