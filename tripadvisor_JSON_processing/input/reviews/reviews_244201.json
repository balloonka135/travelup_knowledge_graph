Then we visited the toilets and they were quite run down and smelt bad.\n\nFirst impressions aren't always right because WOW - we visited the exhibition on climate change and I must say it was innovative, interesting and visually stunning. We were so surprised at how good it was considering all of the above. The exhibition included lots of photography and installation pieces with very clear explanations. Everything was in English which was great for us to be able to understand the art pieces. \n\nThe exhibition was very interactive, the highlight of the exhibition was an immersive experience where you put on headphones in one of the halls, and interact unknowingly with other guests - we were blown away how well it was done.\n\nWe would have loved to see some more exhibitions there so we hope they add more as it would be an amazing gallery if they did!

The exhibition starts in earnest with some very nicely presented aerial photos showing the extent that humans change the face of the planet. Some photos showed both the negative and positive impact humans have; such as dams reducing our reliance on fossil fuels but at the cost of changing the landscape beyond recognition and flooding villages. \n\nThe exhibition includes set pieces, videos and photography, but also a REALLY clever show at the half-way point. Don't skip it on account of having to wait a little while, it's super clever and (like the whole exhibition) can be enjoyed in English, Spanish or Catalan. \n\nSome parts were perhaps a bit style over substance, and other parts were maybe a little preachy, but it was nicely presented and was food for thought.

It is impressive for the effort, but difficult to understand because of the complexity of the work by Ramon Llull. I have always thought that if Ramon Llull had been British, he would have pointed out as the greatest philosopher ever. However, he is only Catalan. I recomend the exhibition because you get the idea of how great he was in different ways, specially trying to put together different cultures (Christian and Muslim) and making use of Catalan as his primary language to convey religion to the population of that time...
