The stop is called Glories, on the L1 RED line and the metro stop is just a few feet across the intersection from Encants. \n\nAs others have noted, this is a three floor market covered up by an immense mirrored ceiling. The market is spread out. As you enter from the intersection, you\u2019ll see a lot of home items such as cloth, small appliances, cosmetics, and other similar items. Look over the railing downstairs and you will see the fleamarket portion.\n\nThere are some bargains to be had such as cheap blouses for one Euro or pants, shorts, underwear, ladies intimates, tools, and some children\u2019s items. And, yes, there are a couple of stalls that have sex toys and DVDs.\n\nThe whole thing takes place out of doors and it\u2019s pretty hot here now. We bought relatively little for the two hours we spent at Encants.\n\nIf you find this review helpful or if you like the photos, could you please give me a thumbs up?

This was a great place to do that.  That large open area in the center of the market consists of vendors selling a variety of smaller antique items.  Some of the tables are more organized than others, but frankly, I prefer a messy table as the prices are usually more negotiable.  I love vintage desk clocks and there were so many to choose from.  I saw old books, cameras, silver, coins--small items perfect to stash in my suitcase.  The vendors are mostly Moroccan but they all speak English and are open to bargaining.  The first price the throw out is never the real price so feel free to haggle.  For example, a vendor wanted 20 euros for a clock. I immediately said no.  He kept asking, \"How much? How much?\" I said, \"I'll give you 5.\"  He took it with no hesitation.  I found the items here to be much cheaper than I could ever buy in the States.  I spent a few hours here on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't very crowded. Upstairs an on the periphery you'll find new goods but I wasn't interested in that kind of shopping. There are bathrooms on site and it is right next to the Glories metro station.  I actually walked here after visiting La Sagrada and the Bullfighting Museum.  It was relatively close.

There are also stalls ( mini shops ) for regular household items, clothes and more ordinary stuff that you may find in a department store. This is obviously a place where the locals come and buy. English is not spoken but well understood. In comparison to similar markets in other southern European cities, the sellers are not aggressive at all, they almost ignore you ( which they probably in fact do, given that this is a place for locals ) and it is quite relaxing to walk around and look without being bothered all the time. But buying is easy if you show the normal courtesy of greeting ( the greeting language probably does not matter, body language is enough, but of course you have to negotiate prices. at most of the sellers, there are no price tags on the items). Payment is mostly in cash, effectively only the minishops or the sellers with more vaulable antiques accept credit cards.There are 2-3 small foodstalls and several modern and clean WC facilities, but overall the place is not for eating/drinking.\n\nUnless you absolutely hate flea markets, do not hesitate to go here, even if it is really \"roustique\".

Some vendors know the value of what they sell and others do not have a clue. Perhaps it is a dish from their great grandmother or an object d'art of museum quality. True story: A woman bought a painting there for 17 euros and took it to a gallery. It was confirmed that it was an original Renoir valued at over 100,000 euros. The fun of Encants is people watching and rummaging through piles of \"trash\" to discover that one treasure. If you have the treasure hunter gene in you, you must visit Encants while in Barcelona.
