Ok, to set standards, if you normally love to eat fresh food and have been to an outdoor farmers market before, than this mercat is just another average market to get fresh fruits, veggies and meats and seafood. For the meats and seafood, you must have a kitchen to take the raw food to cook. There are plenty of seafood stalls who make delicious and exotic seafood dishes while you stand or sit at a very tight bar. I tried the potato\u2019s bravas from a potato stall. They were basically re fried potato but size squares with a mild tomato sauce drizzled on top. The stall cook said the sauce was spicy, but I, personally, thought it was tasteless. I also bought a fresh cup of fruit. It was refreshing and delicious. But for that price, you can get way more fresh fruit from any supermarket. It will be just as fresh and just as tasty. I had a cup of fresh pina coco. It was delicious. I also got a spicy chicken and cheese empanada. It was warm, buttery and flaky. Very good. All in all, I feel the mercat is overrated by all YouTube tourist guides and some reviewers on TripAdvisor. It is the same up priced farmers market that you find anywhere else in the world.
