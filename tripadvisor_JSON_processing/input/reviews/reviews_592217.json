An octagonal fountain acted as a focal point in the area's center, and acacia trees in the space likely provide shade in summer but had few leaves at the end of March. The dominant building proved to be a simple church with a violent history. An information plaque indicated that 42 people -- mostly children -- died here during the Spanish Civil War when Franco's air force bombed the area. The church bears witness to the bombings with a shrapnel-marked facade.\n\nMany of the Gothic buildings went up here in the mid-20th century because of much empty space after the bombings.
