And well worth visiting, too. But G\u00f3tico has a ton of interesting other things, and if you have a few extra hours, will repay aimless wandering. I did some of that the other day, myself, and found this fascinating basilica only a couple of streets south of the main cathedral. South by southeast, of course. You know. Anyway, this is a cool looking church from the outside and even cooler on the inside, with some really prime stained glass. I like new, flashy, modern glass like in that Gaudi place up the way, but there's something special about old, dark windows from the 1500s. Don't miss the 2 euro bell tower, either. I missed it, and I'm just itching to get back and do that. I suspect there's a good view of the Barcelona cathedral from it; it's close to the Jaume I metro.", "publishedDate": "2015-09-27", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 259380813, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4960182-r259380813-Basilica_dels_Sants_Martirs_Just_i_Pastor-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The Bas\u00edlica dels Sants M\u00e0rtirs Just i Pastor (Esgl\u00e9sia dels Sants Just i Pastor) is a beautiful church in the Barri Gotic.
