It cuts the city in two, diagonally from west to east.\n\nThere is not much to say.

Otherwise, it is not extremely interesting to look for it specifically.", "publishedDate": "2015-06-13", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 259617787, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7810574-r259617787-Avinguda_Diagonal-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The Avinguda Diagonal is one of the most important streets in Barcelona.
