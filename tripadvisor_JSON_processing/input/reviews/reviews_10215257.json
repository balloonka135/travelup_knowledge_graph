Main complaint is the small kiosk there.  It's run by two (I believe) Filipinos that are extremely impolite towards tourists that do not buy from them.  I witness them telling tourist and even children to leave their area if they are not buying anything.  It's basically a public area with some benches that people may walk by.  I don't understand why they need to be so rude or maybe they are just discriminating against tourist from certain countries that they do not think will shop from them.", "publishedDate": "2019-11-03", "language": "en", "rating": 1}, {"id": 674584939, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10215257-r674584939-Jardins_del_Mirador_del_Alcalde-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Jardins del Mirador del Alcalde is a lovely area full of green!
