This one is stunning, and if you enjoy the art, beauty, history and tranquility of a cemetery, you should absolutely visit. There were tombs and crypts in all directions, and I\u2019ve never seen a mountainside graveyard before. Every foot of space has been used, and is still being used. \n\nThings to note: this cemetery is a far walk from the Olympic village or the Montjuic park. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any mass transit around... and it\u2019s an extremely hilly part of town! You need to be a strong walker to do this by foot, or plan your bus route carefully. We spent about 40 minutes walking from the Mir\u00f3 museum to the cemetery (downhill) and then again, uphill, all the way back up. \n\nStill worth it!", "publishedDate": "2020-02-06", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 742767804, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4945354-r742767804-Cementerio_de_Montjuic-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This was high on my to do list in Barcelona and it did not disappoint. It isn\u2019t hard to get to (Google maps will tell you where and when the closest bus is) but it goes far enough out of the main tourist spots that you\u2019ll likely be alone when you get there. This makes it peaceful and helps to maintain the respect it deserves. (Although I did catch one lone visitor with a big camera literally climbing off a crypt...some people have no class). Anyway, the place is massive. There are maps available at the main building and an interactive screen to help you choose a route. That helps a little but if you don\u2019t have time for a full trail you\u2019ll just have to wander sort of blind because those maps don\u2019t tell you what they are taking you to (one trail has artistic spots designated only by a number, no description; the other trail has historical graves and at least includes names. There is also a hybrid trail of these). \n\nWe were there for 60-90 minutes and mostly just wandered aimlessly. I can\u2019t be certain but it felt like we saw about 5% of the place. It is massive and virtually every tomb is unique. The mausoleums are mostly huge and impressive, some the size of small chapels. Many of the more artistic tombs feature life size angels weeping, sculptures of the deceased, etc. and the hillside looks like a mosaic of tombs. \n\nI could\u2019ve spent many hours there.

It is estimated that Spain has more mass graves than any country besides Cambodia, and most of them are unmapped and unmarked. The Fossar has been turned into a memorial for those who are buried there, and also contains memorials to the men and women of the CNT who died fighting against fascism, to the volunteers of the International Brigades during the Civil War, and to victims of the Holocaust all across Europe.
