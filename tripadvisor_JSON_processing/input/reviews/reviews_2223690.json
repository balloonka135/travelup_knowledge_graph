It was founded in the fourteenth century by Queen Elisenda de Montcada with the support of her husband King James II. It became immediately the house of the Poor Clare Order. It's in gothic style and in this respect it can be considered as a good example of Catalan gothic architecture as regards both the church and the Monastery cloister.\nThe church outer fa\u00e7ade is quite sober though its octagonal belfry tower, its beautiful portal by the tower base and the stained glass windows have undeniably some charm. Its great simplicity contrasts its grandeur, altogether reflecting the characteristics of the mendiant architecture of southern Europe. It's a single nave church whose interior is quite impressive precisely because of its sobriety and also its lighting. The side chapels are very interesting and the ribbed vault is quite attractive. Special attention deserves the sepulchre of Queen Elisenda, housed in the presbitery, which has two sides, one facing into the church, where she is dressed in royal attire, and the other one looking onto the cloister where she is represented as a penitent widow. Other interesting features of that church are: the already mentioned stained glass windows (they date back from the sixteenth century when they were replaced following the introduction of the reform of the Strict Observance during that century), other sepulchres and the three choirs (triforium choir loft, chancel choir and the central monks' choir).\nHalf a way between the church and the cloister there is a small chapel dedicated to St. Michael which is an exciting lieu to be observed particularly on account of its frescoes depicting some scenes of Jesus and Mary's lifes.\nThe cloister is really marvellous. It has three floors, the two higher ones supported by columns whose capitals are decorated with emblems of the King of Aragon and the House of Montcada. The pointed arches between every two of those columns are really beautiful. In the cloister center there is a garden with a fountain in the middle. Altogether it forms a gorgeous ensemble. The place is in general rather peaceful, thus adequate to spend a long while in an oasis of peace in a city whose bustle is by the way remarkable.\nThe monument concerned is a bit far from the city center but it's easily accessible particularly by bus. The visit of the monastery is worth the while anyway. Apart from the parts thereof already pointed out one can likewise have the possibility to visit different Monastery rooms such as the kitchen, the refectory and the nursery. There is even a museum in the former dormitory of the monastery. There one can behold sacred and everyday objects from the 14th to the 20th centuries. In addition to Queen Elisenda's grave referred to above there one can see other graves appertaining to superiors of the Monastery and cells on the northern side of the cloister.\nBy and large therefore, it's an interesting as well as stunning place to visit in Barcelona, which shouldn't be missed while being on tour in the mentioned city.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-14", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 681836055, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2223690-r681836055-Reial_Monestir_de_Santa_Maria_de_Pedralbes-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Nice architecture.
