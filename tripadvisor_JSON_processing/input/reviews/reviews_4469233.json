Pacha, Opium and Shoko, we went to both Pacha and Shoko and both were really good nights, 10euro entry with a free drink. Also next to the port is a lovely beach which had plenty of sunbeds which you did have to pay for but many other beaches nearby didn't have any sunbeds. Also had a few beach bars which had good food and drinks and the bar men would serve you from your sunbeds.", "publishedDate": "2015-11-07", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 322355075, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4469233-r322355075-Port_Olimpic-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "there are muscular man ski and trained at the beach that you will love to stay. those bars and restaurant is nice but a bit too commercial.", "publishedDate": "2015-10-27", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 320761460, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4469233-r320761460-Port_Olimpic-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This is a go-to place if you are after a fantastic night life in Barcelona.
