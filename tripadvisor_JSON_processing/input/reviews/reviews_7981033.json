Far from common beaches.\n\nIn Barcelona, I discovered another approach. Go to one of the most frequently visited beaches and start fishing. This gentleman obviously thought that fishing with sharp angles among small children was OK. \n\nSeveral police officers tried to give him some good advice not to use the lure among the bathing people. They got no response. Guess tourists are not that welcome in Barcelona anymore.

After having a walk along Barceloneta earlier in the week we wanted to get a bit further out away from the crowds. \n\nWe got the Metro to Ciutadella Vila Ol\u00edmpica and after a 10 minute walk were on the Port Olimpic. Platja de la Nova Icaria is on the left hand side of the port as you look at it from the Metro station. \n\nAs a tourist we didn't have our own umbrellas, wind breakers or chairs so opted to use those available to rent on the beach. After setting ourselves up we found it was 24 Euro for two sun beds and an umbrella which seems rather expensive. It didn't matter if you stayed for 1 hour or 6 hours, the cost was the same. Many people made the same comment when faced with the cost, and some chose to have just the umbrella and use their towels to lay on which is a good option. If you do want a bed I would recommend getting there before lunch time as it does get busy, but also you might as well make the most of your time at that cost! \n\nThe Balearic Sea was absolutely freezing, but a nice way to cool down after a day sunbathing!\n\nThere were toilets available on the beach which were free and did seem to be regularly cleaned and attended to.", "publishedDate": "2015-06-04", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 275781808, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7981033-r275781808-Platja_de_la_Nova_Icaria-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "My fiancee and I spent an afternoon here laying out on a towel, playing in the (cold) water, people watching, eating tapas at an excellent spot (Escriba).  \n\nSome locals recommended this beach, essentially, going more east and avoiding Barceloneta due to tourists.\n\nPort Olimpico is next door and a short walk with a \"boardwalk\" of several restaurants.\n\nPeople seemed to be minding their own business, but we were very active in our efforts not to be victims.   \n\nFYI - boobies are every where.  The neighboring beach (Mar Bella) had many men bearing it all.  Also, be sure to bring sunscreen.
