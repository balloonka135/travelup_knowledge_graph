It was one of the first works of the young Antoni Gaud\u00ed.In that time after graduating as an architect he collaborated  as a draftsman with Josep Fontser\u00e8 i Mestre in the entrance gate of the Ciutadella Park. He made the design of two different models of  gas lamps. In the Plaza Reial are located two of them with six arms. Starting from the stone base, we can see a large iron medallion, with floral motifs.   Halfway up we see the Barcelona shield with the four bars and the cross of St. George  and above some small floral ornaments of red color. The arms are placed on different levels, as if they were the branches of a tree, each holding a glass lantern covered with a wrought iron crown. The  crown represents the winged helmet of the Roman god Mercury, with two snakes coiled in the central arm. All the symbology represents the commercial power of the city of Barcelona. They were inaugurated in September 1879. Absolutely beautiful.", "publishedDate": "2019-11-17", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 690179483, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10538407-r690179483-Fanals-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The Fanals are lampposts in Placa Reial and not lanterns as the name suggests.
