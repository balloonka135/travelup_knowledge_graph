Lots of steel structures some very clever all over the park but it is a steel sculpture largely. No idea how to describe this place - look at pictures and make up your own mind.

A few years ago it was still a bit quiet sometimes and as a relatively new park the plants and tress had not grown enough yet.  But it\u2019s better now and certainly quirky.  Great place for a picknick on the little hill as well and the slides for kids are good.
