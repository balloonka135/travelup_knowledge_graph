Thank goodness we discovered this gem on our last day in Barcelona! I wasn't expecting very much. It totally blew us away. In retrospect, one should do this before doing any other Gaudi experience. It gives you the arc of his life and work, by which the other experiences, including SF, would be better understood. It has more models of the SF than SF itself, not to mention models, including computer models, of other works. It is an audio guided tour. Not only is this the first time I haven't skipped entries in an audio guided tour: several I listened to two or three times. In particular those accompanied by videos. I don't mind saying some gave me goosebumps or made my eyes tear up.

I visited this exhibition after the Sagrada Familia in the morning, and Casa Batllo in the afternoon.  The reason I say this is because I believe the order in which you view the works of Gaudi and learn about his story, will affect your experience in any one of these attractions.  And so, after seeing the stunning architecture, walking through this exhibition was a treat!\n\nFirst of all, the exhibition will take you 2 hours.  I recall around 50 (I think it was 53) audio clips and some videos, and each is roughly 90 seconds long.  So with walking and observation, 1.5-2 hours in total.  These 2 hours are thoroughly rewarding - both during the exhibition, and at the conclusion.  What is beautiful about this exhibition is that it enhances your experience of other Gaudi related attractions, including those you would already have seen.  I must confess that as a frequent traveller, I often see things that I do not fully appreciate the significance of.  This exhibition ensured that was not the case for the various Gaudi pieces I visited during my stay.  \n\nI strongly recommend this to any tourist who has seen any of the Sagrada Familia, Park Guell or Casa Batllo.  I would add a few very minor points: my friend's phone ran out of battery half way through - check this at the beginning and ensure they give you a phone above 50%; some videos weren't working which was a shame, though hopefully they will correct that.

They changed my view of Gaudi completely. I had an ill-informed opinion that Gaudi was a mediocre talent with a flair for the bizarre and unusual; in fact I assumed that his surname was the origin of the word gaudy. I couldn't have been more wrong. \n\nI left with an entirely different opinion: LSF embodies Gaudi's deep religious convictions, and its design is the product of dedicated genius. I may not share Gaudi's religious convictions, but his genius is reflected in his work. \n\nOne of the most impressive exhibits was the \"upside-down wire-frame structural model\" of LSF: As you walk in the main basilica of LSF, and look at the massive stone supporting structure, you see that it resembles the branches of a giant tree (several giant trees). It occurred to me that a structural analysis would have been essential for such a complex structure, and I wondered how (or even if) such an analysis had been done. Gaudi's \"analysis\" was revealed in one of the exhibits - the \"upside-down wire-frame structural model\"! Briefly, Gaudi constructed a wire frame scaled model of LSF, mounted it to a board, and turned it upside down. He simulated the loading on the structure by hanging small bags with weights in them from the upside-down wire frame. I was impressed! \n\nThe Exhibit also told the shocking and sad story of Gaudi's death.
