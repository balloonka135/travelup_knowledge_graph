It was a last minute decision and thought that even if it's not top rate we will get a flavour of it.  And for \u20ac15 for balcony seats what could we lose.  What a great night we had.  The theatre is a little gem.  It has the feel of a real community run venture.  Nothing posh but lots and lots of atmosphere. A mixed audience came in for the 8 o' clock performance including families which was fab.  The dancers and musicians were great. A quick tip - if you go for the cheap balcony tickets there is no reserved seats and the best spot is at the head of the balcony on bar stools.  So do go earlyish if you want one of these \nA great night out.

Classic and classy. Way to go on preserving the history of this theatre. Great atmosphere and entertainment before the show on fridays and saturdays with the organist. The staff are super friendly and the admission is great. I even seen they used this theatre in a Geico commercial.Best popcorn ever. Sometimes I just come for the popcorn, free refills too.

We purchased cheap tickets the evening of the performance for 10 euro with included a drink. Although the selection is not great, the drink was descent. The performance is engaging, except for the \"plant\" part, where they seemingly randomly select a person from an audience that can fill in a part of an absent performer, which very quickly became obvious that he was not really a part of the audience. Otherwise, we had descent seats with a view.  Not sure if I would have the same opinion if I paid full price for the show, but considering the discounted tickets it was a nice way to spend the late evening.", "publishedDate": "2014-04-05", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 194883274, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244904-r194883274-Teatre_Principal-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The interior and exterior is very nice and the place had a great atmosphere. The show we saw was called Surprise and we caught it on a day where it was cheaper. The regular price for the dinner and show was 90 per person but we got it for 50. The dinner is a full course meal including a starter, main course, and desert. But drinks were separate. The drinks, by the way, were very good and strong but a little pricy. The waiters were good not the best but good. The food was very good and the show was great especially the acrobatic pair performing some impressive feats. Over all it was a very enjoyable experience. The price seems reasonable since it is a dinner and show. The service overall was good with the hostess and ticket personnel being helpful and telling us specifically that the night we went was at a discount.", "publishedDate": "2014-02-21", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 190687700, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244904-r190687700-Teatre_Principal-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "It has not available basic drinks as orange juice...Very few brands of drinks to choose.

However, the aggressiveness of the staff was worrying. When we, along with plenty of other people, asked for customer complaint forms they didn't want to give them to us which is against the law.
