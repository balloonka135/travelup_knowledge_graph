Wonderful experience. I'll definitely go again.", "publishedDate": "2017-09-29", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 418015925, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8476175-r418015925-Microteatre_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Even though I don't speak Catalan and my Spanish is very basic, I love coming to Microteatre to see a couple of short plays and have a few glasses of wine (or a delicious mojito!).\n\nThe food is also really great - simple but delicious sandwich combos - one perfect salad - and yummy Nutella crepes.\n\nThe talent is always top notch, and there's every possibility of seeing a TV star acting there or a YouTube celebrity. And with ten new shows to choose from each month (5 in the afternoon, 5 in the evening), you should definitely keep coming back over and over again. :)", "publishedDate": "2016-09-13", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
