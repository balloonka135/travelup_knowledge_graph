Built as a family home for a rich industrialist, Palau Macaya passed through various uses before being turned into a cultural centre run by the La Caixa Foundation. Apart from the elegant decorated street facade, it is enough just to pop in to the light-filled atrium that serves as an entry hall with its balustraded staircase and tiled walls and floor. There is also an interesting photographic exhibition about the building and its architect.", "publishedDate": "2020-01-01", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 675885173, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d531596-r675885173-Casa_Macaia_Palau_Macaya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I immediately saw from outside and walk to the hall.

It's got some very lighthearted sculptures on it and makes for some nice photos.  I recommend stopping by because it is on the way to La Sagrada Familia (assuming you're coming from the Las Ramblas, Passeig de Gracia area.  I've attached a couple of photos.  \n\nUnless you're a Moderniste nut...don't go out of your way...but again, assuming you're strolling to Sagrada...it's worth the two minute diversion off the main track.", "publishedDate": "2013-05-25", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
