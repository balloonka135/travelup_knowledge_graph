I admit, if this building were somewhere else, I would have probably given this a 5-star rating. Unfortunately, I think Barcelona has more to offer and, if I had to make a short selection of things not to miss in this stunning city, Casa Amatller wouldn't be on the top of the list.\nFirst of all, I think the exterior is more fascinating than the interiors so it is easy to walk in with too high expectations. Second, you can only visit the 1st floor and the visit is only 45 minutes so it doesn't feel like a full experience given the ticket price. Third, the format of the visit is a mix between a guided tour and self-guided visit with a tablet while at that point I would have preferred just to stick with the guide the whole time.\nThese are my reasons not to give the 5 stars but I want to highlight that this is still a very interesting experience and I am happy I had the chance to visit it.
