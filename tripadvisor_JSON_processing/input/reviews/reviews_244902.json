Then found out it was totally fenced off and locked with access cards only , this included the beautiful grounds and pathways. This ensures that the person who is outside cannot get in , nor can you access the public paths and walkways ensuring an entire block has zero access. Pompous rear ends comes to mind. Unfortunately it means walkers have to circle the darn building and block to carry on.
