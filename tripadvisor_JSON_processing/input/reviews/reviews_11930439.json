The sculpture depicts a woman protecting her modesty while averting her gaze. A scene reminiscent of the biblical story of Susanna falsely accused by lecherous voyeurs and in particular the painting \"La Casta Susana\u201d by Juan Manuel Blanes. The sculpture has many elements of Baroque attention to detail, especially around the legs, the folds of her towel and the pained expression of embarrassment on her face.\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of the better statues in the Plaza.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-15", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 677322395, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d11930439-r677322395-Dona_Pescadora-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Dona Pescadora is the beautiful sculpture of a woman, or \"fisher woman\". She is facing sidewards, so we only see one side of her face. She seems to have been caught unawares, as her breasts are exposed and she is making an attempt to shield herself. This pose is reminiscent of ancient classical, Greek sculptures, and specifically that of Aphrodite, who is depicted naked and attempts unsuccessfully to cover herself. This statue, however, is a bit different in that it is not a naked one. It is at the entrance to Plaza de Catalunya. It is a must visit sight.", "publishedDate": "2019-05-29", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 584035627, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d11930439-r584035627-Dona_Pescadora-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This statue stands on a pedestal and is recessed in the structure behind.
