It's a very good complement of the main places in Barcelona. It's not a touristic place and could be a good place to rest for a while and get into an old atmosphere.

We took a chance and climbed the stairs to be rewarded with a gem of a small and charming library. The staff were happy to allow us to look around and enjoy the ambience of the interior. If you like old books and prints and/or turn of 19/20c decoration then please give this unique collection and its surroundings 20 minutes of your time...you will not be disappointed.", "publishedDate": "2016-10-20", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
