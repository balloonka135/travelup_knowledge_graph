However, I will confess that I was staying nearby at the Barcelona Hilton and this was on of 3 things I did early before leaving for a 10:30 flight back to the US. However early in the morning, 7:15, was a great time because I had it all to myself. \n\nWith all that said even as a gate you can see in the Gaudi everywhere, the assemtryical sides that mirror nature, the parabolic arch in the gate and the cross at the top. Plus it is hard to miss the statue of Gaudi which requires the obligatory selfie. Also impressive is the way the trees seem to fit with the structure even though it is clear the buildings are considerably newer than the structure. \n\nWhile I agree that it is hard to make a special trip for this, if you are in the area and you love Gaudi, make the time to see it and combine with other sites in the area.", "publishedDate": "2017-07-24", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 372265746, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d6500682-r372265746-Porta_de_la_Finca_Miralles-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Stumbled on this by accident when we got lost, quite an impressive building, most interesting was his statue to take a photo along side", "publishedDate": "2016-05-11", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 339397593, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d6500682-r339397593-Porta_de_la_Finca_Miralles-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Unless you\u2019re staying really close to it or have a lot of time to spare or is a Gaudi aficionado, it is not worth going there. We were staying in the area (about 15 minutes away on foot) and had nine full days on our hands and that was not worth it. It is interesting and has that organic-like Gaudi style and that\u2019s about it. Pavellons Guell with its iron dragon in its fa\u00e7ade is kind of near; we went to see both and this detour was a bit unremarkable and a waste of time, honestly.
