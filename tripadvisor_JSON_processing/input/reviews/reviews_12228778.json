When I see their recent displays I would like to buy them all because they are simple, beautiful and with so much detail that captures your eye from far. The  gallerists are extraordinary!!! I highly recommend a visit to admire their art.", "publishedDate": "2019-11-07", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
