It has been there for decades and it is one of the most important in Europe. It hosts many exhibitions of various kinds where companies showcase their products. The building is a nice architectural sight. There was a car exhibition during our visit. Quite interesting. The building, or complex of buildings, is next to the \"Magic Fountain\" and the Art Museum and visitors are thus given the chance to admire several sights within easy walking distance of each other.", "publishedDate": "2019-05-23", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 675281781, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1418568-r675281781-Barcelona_Fira_Montjuic_Hall_of_Conferences-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I love this place, if you like cars and the world of automobile in general, i really recommend it to you.

And the Barcelona Fira Montjuic Hall of Conferences is just located opposite to it. The architectural design of the buildings is very beautiful and lovely.\n\nAccording to our guide, this place could be dated back to 1929 when Barcelona hosted the World Expo (not sure if I remembered correctly on the year) and it was then a grand event. Some of the current buildings remained as they were, with some being renovated and reconstructed. The place is now mainly used for exhibitions and conferences.\n\nAs we had limited time, we did not manage to enter but just simple walked around the external of the building. True enough it's very huge and the surrounding area is also very nice and splendid. It's clean and well maintained and we love the ambience!", "publishedDate": "2018-07-06", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 531623627, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1418568-r531623627-Barcelona_Fira_Montjuic_Hall_of_Conferences-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "It was very nice and big!

To our surprise the TV were filming in the area and as we arrived the fountains were turned on in all their glory. We were able to watch the performance with only a few hundred other spectators and had perfect views whereas normally thousands of people crowd the area and a good viewing spot is hard to come by.
