It is interesting to see how artists express their feelings about common topics like love, war, pain, life.. in a very different ways from normal people like me (with no artistic tendency :D). On the day i visited, the museum had some art event for kids on the first floor, lucky me to have a chance to see all the budding artists express themselves through drawing. Overall, a relaxing and self exploration stroll in a well designed modern building.

The Calder sculptures are amazing! The Takis exhibit was mind blowing and just plain fun. Adults and children will really enjoy his exhibit. I spent more than two hours here.

A huge mirror (I'm guessing 10 metres by 5 metres) which had been mounted in a massive gilded frame and then the whole thing cut into 4 panels and leaning against a wall.  \"All life is a mirror\" it proclaimed.  A ball of twine had a miniature water tap screwed into it.  MACBA is expensive, and I didn't feel that I got good value here.
