Until the end of the nineteenth century, Gr\u00e0cia used to be a borough autonomous from the city of Barcelona at a municipal level, with its own authorities and local municipal system. Due to the fact that Barcelona spread out considerably Gracia was then embraced by that city thus becoming a part of its urban ensemble. Still nowadays there is what is called the Gr\u00e0cia Town Hall in the Pla\u00e7a Vila de Gr\u00e0cia where a council holding limited powers sits from time to time to deal with matters in connection with the district.\nAs stated, most of the district streets are relatively narrow with no much traffic. Therefore, strolling along those streets is rather pleasant. Sometimes one can even have the feeling that he is not in a big city like Barcelona but rather in a village as the atmosphere of past times is somehow preserved. Of course there are some urban roads where the traffic is heavier, such as Gran de Gr\u00e0cia, Travessera de Gr\u00e0cia, Travessera de Dalt and carrer Escorial. In order to have a nice walk it\u2019s recommendable to avoid such roads. It\u2019s possible to go to that district by tube. Then it\u2019s advisable to get out at Fontana station and one is already full in the district. One of the streets where that station stands is carrer Asturias, which is a pedestrian road and starting from there it\u2019s a good way to commence a tour within the district. Another possibility would be to get out at Diagonal tube station and then walk up towards the Pla\u00e7a Vila de Gr\u00e0cia along, for instance, carrer St. Pere Martir and from the said square towards carrer Verdi sauntering along Ram\u00f3n y Cajal and Pla\u00e7a de la Revoluci\u00f3 and continue towards travessera de Dalt. Some beautiful squares appear from time to time when walking at random in the district: the already stated Pla\u00e7a Vila de Gr\u00e0cia, as well as the Pla\u00e7a del Sol, Pla\u00e7a de la Virreina, Pla\u00e7a del Diamant, Pla\u00e7a Rovira I Trias, Pla\u00e7a del Nord, etc. In those squares there are usually some good terraces where it\u2019s very pleasant to sit for a while and have a drink. In the first one of those just mentioned, the terrace of the Bar Nou Candanch\u00fa is particularly agreeable.\nThe district concerned is plenty of caf\u00e9s, bars and restaurants. It\u2019s currently in fashion so that many youngsters abound in its streets, squares and in the said commercial premises. Apart from the interest that the district itself arouses one can come across some interesting buildings when taking a stroll in its streets. For example, in carrer Carolinas, on the left hand side of carrer Gran de Gr\u00e0cia going towards Pla\u00e7a Lesseps there is a beautiful modernist building by Gaudi (Casa Vicens). Likewise there are two markets, one on each side of the said carrer Gran de Gr\u00e0cia. It\u2019s advisable to visit them and even to buy some fruit there. Some churches, such as that of St. Pere, and small parks are also worth being visited.\nSometimes special events are held in that district and occasionally some streets or parts of them are closed to the traffic so that pedestrians can walk freely on the roadway with no risk whatsoever. In summer, from August 15th and for a whole week there are the district festivities (fiestas de Gracia) and then manifold events take place in the open air: music, dance, companionship repasts, games for children and for adults, fireworks, etc. At that time many streets or sections of them are closed to the traffic and they are decorated in a very peculiar, funny, clever and witty manner. A ceiling-like scheme is placed at a certain height. It\u2019s made of slips of paper or some other objects such as plastic bottles or cans or incredible items. Besides, some figures made of cardboard or papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and over elevated platforms representing ships, castles, houses, etc. made of wood, cloth or also cardboard are placed somewhere in the middle or the sides of the streets concerned. Some plastic swimming pools for the children are also displayed and the whole is very colourful, showy, gay and interesting. During that time of course the saunter along the streets adorned in the way described is even exciting and a highly recommendable activity so as to observe a unique pageantry which exists pretty much nowhere else. Unfortunately, most of those papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 or cardboard figures don\u2019t last untouched until the end of the festivities as they are subject to vandalism. Therefore one or two days after their having been set up just a few remain unscathed and it\u2019s a shame to see that many of them have been therefore mutilated, maltreated or abused. This can of course be considered as an example of the primitive and uneducated temperament of most of Spanish people.", "publishedDate": "2017-06-05", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 486101433, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d271008-r486101433-Barri_de_Gracia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Short walk from Passeig de Gracia/Diagonal.
