We've all been to Barcelona several times and were excited to look at the handmade craft stores and eat at some great tapas bars and restaurants, and generally feeling the vibe of the Gothic area and El Born.  This is a warning to be careful, as I was very careful and had very little on me when I was pickpocketed.  I'm pretty sure the street we were on was Carrer de la Boria, which was filled with interesting graffiti and small interesting stores and local bars and markets. We stopped at a gelato place, mostly open to the street about midway on the street.  The young girl at the counter took my money on the highest counter which made me reach up and made it difficult to keep my small cross body bag under my arm as I was carrying it through the day.  In retrospect, she also did some dropping and shuffling with the money which kept my hands up high (one hand with gelato, the other trying to get the change).  I noticed the phone gone from my purse within a block later.  Many of the salespeople there said the pickpockets work in packs, and sometimes are part of the restaurant where this happens.  Although we were not in a restaurant, I wish I had reported it to the police so they could have checked this out, but it's very hard while lacking time and traveling in another country.  I felt lucky that it was just my phone, although a 3 month old Iphone X, still felt lucky.  Be extra careful!  I'm a seasoned aware traveler and don't think there was much I could have done differently, so don't take passports and much cash, whatever you do.
