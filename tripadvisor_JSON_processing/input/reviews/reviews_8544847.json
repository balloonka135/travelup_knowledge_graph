The church has a single nave with a wide floor divided into six sections, with ribbed vaults typical of Gothic architecture. It has a pentagonal apse, covered with a vault that resembles a boat sail blown by the wind. By far the most impressive parts of the church is the stained glass windows depicting the church watching over it's flock, and the cloister with it's mini garden.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-15", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
