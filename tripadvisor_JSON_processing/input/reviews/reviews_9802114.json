Even if the reason for the memorial doesn't spring an interest in you, the actual memorial itself is worthy of seeing for its great size and beauty.\n\nThe memorial is enormous and striking and is located in a little square where people sell all sorts of items in a type of local village market square.", "publishedDate": "2017-05-08", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
