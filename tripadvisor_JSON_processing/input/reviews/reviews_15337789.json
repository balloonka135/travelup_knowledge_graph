Now it is full of very beautiful graffitis and in the place there are some events every tear. We came here to the vadevermut (18th and 19th of May), where you can drink some different vermouths and eat something like cheeses, cured sausages, patatas bravas or other dishes. Very alternative and good place to drink a vermouth.", "publishedDate": "2019-05-29", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 664886175, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d15337789-r664886175-Nave_Bostik-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I went to Nau Bostik to attend the Craft Film Festival, a weekend long festival of international independent films.  This is a former glue factory repurposed as a cultural center.  A couple of artists had there work on exhibit as well, most notably Tania Font.  Even the building is worth seeing from the outside with the various paintings done on the walls.  I hope the Trip Advisor editors will correct the spelling - it is Nau Bostik, as confirmed in their website.  And I would advise checking the website regarding the activities taking place when you visit Barcelona.", "publishedDate": "2019-04-08", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
