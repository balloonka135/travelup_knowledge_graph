It is a beautiful building located on Carrer Ausi\u00e0s March. You can only visit this private place once a week. Tours are organized by \"Cases Singulars\" a great association which promotes the historic houses in Barcelona. There are magnificent stained- glass windows and intricate carpentry. It is now the headquarter of the Fundaci\u00f3 Vila Casas which is a center/institution for the promotion of contemporary art. The place is just amazing, out of the beaten path of Gaudi's Casa Batlo.. and it is really worth the visit for those who love art and modernism.", "publishedDate": "2019-03-05", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
