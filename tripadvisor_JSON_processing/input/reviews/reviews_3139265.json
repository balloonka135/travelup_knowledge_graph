Maria del Pi (Virgin of the Pine Tree). The name is put down to the existence of a huge pine tree on the spot when the then new town bearing the same name originated. The present church started being built in the first half of the fourteenth century and apparently its construction lasted longer than 126 years.\nThe church is in gothic style with a rather sober fa\u00e7ade. The belfry tower is the most outstanding outer element of the church. It was built under the architect Bartomeu Mas's design most probably in the fifteenth century. Some elements which were part of the ancient romanesque portal can still be observed in the Avemaria's portal facing St. Josep Oriol square. The said fa\u00e7ade has a rectangular shape and it's flanked by two towers. The ornamented rose window is really astounding on account of its elaborate manufacture and its unusually large size. This element and the main entrance with all the niches, arches and other features in the portal and around it are the only fa\u00e7ade parts contrasting its general sobriety.\nOnce inside one is struck by both its sobriety and its grandeur. The church layout and its conception are the typical ones of the Catalan gothic churches. It's a single nave church with side chapels deprived of any sculptural decoration. The ceiling consists in a ribbed vault divided in seven sections. The side chapels are each of them between two buttresses and it's in some of them where the sole baroque elements can be found, such as pillars with Corynthian capitals over the altars. They are very nice chapels, particularly that dedicated to the Helpless Virgin. Another chapel is dedicated to St. Joaquima de Vedruna i de Mas, who was baptised in that temple in 1783. The image of the Virgin presiding over the church was made by the sculptor Enric Monjo in 1973. It's a very nice carving worth of being observed carefully for a while.\nAttached to the basilica there is the chapel of the Holy Blood. It was built originally in the second half of the fifteenth century but it was set on fire during the Spanish Civil War. It was rebuilt as it is nowadays in 1952. At its inception it was used as a chapter house but in the seventies of the seventieth century it was conveyed to the Archguild of the Very Pure Blood.\nThe Basilica of Sta. Maria del Pi is an interesting church, as can be gathered from the foregoing, whose visit is worth the while. Apart from the imposing majestic inner architecture enhanced at day time by the brightness ascribable to the light coming through the stained glass windows, there one may feel a very peaceful atmosphere partly due to the fact that the surrounding area is also a rather calm part of the city, with little traffic. The negative point is that they make one pay to enter that temple, which doesn't seem to be in line with the relevant doctrine.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-18", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 688508772, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d3139265-r688508772-Basilica_de_Santa_Maria_del_Pi-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Wondered around the streets and stumbled upon this cute Basilica.
