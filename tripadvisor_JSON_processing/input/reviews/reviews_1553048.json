The Barcelona botanic gardens affords the first, but none of the rest.\n\nWe had been visiting the Montjuic fort on a hot summer day and wanted a nice walk down through the gardens to the art gallery. Our first mistake was trying to get in the back way  from the upper slopes. There's only one entrance and that is at the bottom of the hill across the road from the olympic stadium.\n\nHaving paid our 3.50 EUR entrance we looked around for a cafe or air conditioned bookstore facilities. Nope. They have a collection of poorly stocked vending machines instead (they do have toilets though). So we set off to visit the \"exposition\" space at the top corner of the gardens. We slogged along the broad concrete boulevards in the full midday sun, with the heat reflecting off the concrete and back onto us.\n\nWhat we did see was a selection of plants laid out thematically from around the world. They did seem to be universally from arid areas, so forget the lush and verdant botanic gardens you might find in other great european centers. It actually reminded us a lot of the botanic gardens in Canberra, Australia. A very similar harsh climate, and similarly set on quite a steep hillside, but the gardens in Canberra had a lot more diversity and interesting nooks and crannies. The Barcelona gardens also seemed neglected with quite a few dying or dead plants and zero evidence of any gardeners on the middle of a Monday.\n\nWe shortly reached the exposition center to find a two story 50m long building that was apparently completely deserted and with no displays set up. We got a beverage from a vending machine and just sat on the slate floor for 15 minutes. At least it was in shade from the building.\n\nSeating was sparse in the gardens and where we did find some it was in full sun. There were no picnic spaces, only a half-acre of dry stubble that had a sign warning us to keep out. There was only one  semi-interesting water feature down near the bottom of the slope, towards the exit of the gardens.\n\nThe only saving grace at the end of the day was that the gardens are small and we spent only half an hour there, mostly gazing out at the view over the olympic park from the deserted exhibition center.

We had been visiting the Olympic Stadium & decided to walk to the gardens which was about 5 minutes away.  We visited on a Sunday & arrived at the botanical gardens at 1435.  The member of staff at the ticket booth advised that from 1500 each sunday there is no admission charge so my husband & I sat outside on a bench & chilled in the sun for 25 minutes.  Sure enough at 1500 we were allowed to enter free of charge.\n\nThe gardens are so big you would need to allow a few hours if you wanted to visit all areas.  We started off in  \"Australia\" & then side-stepped over to \"South Africa\".  It wasn't the botanic gardens I was used to visiting with fresh flowers around - trees & plants were more familiar around this garden.  It was still very interesting & such a pleasant way to spend the afternoon.\n\nThe paths can be steep at times & in the hot Barcelonian sun I would advise lots of water to drink.  There are water taps spread out around the gardens for you to drink from but if you have a sensitive stomach I wouldn't.  I filled my empty water bottle with the drinking water & gulped some down immediately.  It took my husband & I approximately 15-20 minutes after that to reach the Botanical Institute at the top of a hill & that was the precise time my stomach decided that it did not like the water & I had to run for the loo!  Luckily there were toilet facilities at the Institute (one male & one female along with a vending machine) or else I would have been ducking behind one of the many palm trees.  My stomach continued to be upset later on that day in which my husband commented that usually I walk as slow as a snail but out of nowhere I was moving like Usain Bolt to get to our hotel bathroom.\n\nBesides my impromptu toilet dash I really did enjoy my trip to the botanical gardens.  They even had a cute \"bee hotel\" but unfortunately no bees to be found just flies instead.  Taking into consideration the amount of overcrowded tourist attractions in Barcelona this place is like a haven of peace & quiet.\n\nCall into the gardens before or after you visit the Olympic Stadium.
