It's full of shops, bars, wonderful buildings and a few wonderful street performers. It felt very homely, and it could easily be my favourite part of the city.\n\nOn our trip we stayed in Barri Gotic, which we loved, but if (when!) we return to Barcelona, we will definitely try to find a place to sleep in el Born.

It's very crowded by days with tourists and locals but lively by night with mostly locals.  Sometimes they pull a all night sales on all the shops and it would be as crowded as daytime; I am not a night persona but I have been to one and it was very fun worth staying up for. \n\nAlso, it is a street for young people to be in since young fashion designers prefer to live and have small shops in this neighborhood.", "publishedDate": "2012-04-21", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 127548564, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d254719-r127548564-Passeig_del_Born-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "There's always something happening in the Passeig del Born + lots of lovely places to have a drink, tapas or a proper meal", "publishedDate": "2012-04-09", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
