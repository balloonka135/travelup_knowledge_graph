Casa Mulleras was originally built in 1868 and remodeled in a Neoclassical style by Enric Sagnier between 1906 and 1911, as commissioned by Ramon Mulleras. The more sober Neoclassical style of Casa Mulleras contrasts sharply with its more opulent Modernist architecture neighbors. Nonetheless, Casa Mulleras does incorporate some eclectic features from Rococo architecture such as the gallery and the balconies. Another beautiful building to enjoy.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-17", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 689586984, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d15532136-r689586984-Casa_Mulleras-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Casa Mulleras is a building in the \"Illa de la Disc\u00f2rdia\u201d of Passeig de Gracia, in the same block of buildings as Casa Bonet, Casa Amatller, Casa Lle\u00f3 i Morera and Casa Batll\u00f3. Unlike the latter three, but similar to Casa Bonet, this building is built in the Neo-Classical style in contrast to the opulent Catalan Modernism. Despite the seeming restrained design when juxtaposed against Catalan Modernism, this building has some beautiful features such as the bay windows, the gallery just above it on the first floor and the classical balconies on either side of it.\n\nWorth a look if visiting Illa de la Disc\u00f2rdia", "publishedDate": "2019-07-14", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
