The site has a number of tile designs in exposed brick. Also you see several parabolic arches that Gaudi loved so much. However the highlight is the dragon gate which also shows a Gaudi feature with wrought iron designs. This one is perhaps his best and it was one of his first. I love it because he put such detail into a minor structure for the overall property. Once you see it, you understand why Guell latched on the architect from some of his greatest work. \n\nAlso notice the design in Guell's initials and the flower pot on top with a iron plant and flowers.

We have seen the picture from a review and hope to see it with our own eyes. So we start the search by Metro Metro to Diagonal station and track for the place from Google map. The place is on Pedrabels road but the Diagonal station is a bit far beyond the entrance of the road, so we entered the wrong road and wandered around hopelessly. Someone there knew the place, someone didn't! So we have to show everyone who was likely to know this place. It took us an hour to find it with exhaution. Finally we found the DRAGON! He opened his mouth very very wide with scary sharp teeth almost devoured us all. This Gaudi' s masterpiece could express the feeling of the DRAGON as alive! Have to see it yourself! It' s on the fence door of Finca Guell, a small house of Gaudi's friend, I think. On the way back, it took only 5 minutes to reach the Diagonal station when we crosses the highway Diagonal street, walk further to the west (direction to the big hospital) at see the M sign. So the next day we come back again with confidence, off the metro at Diagonal station, walked to east ( direction away from the big hospital) then found a five-star hotel (big tall building) and then cross the Diagonal street. Walk right into the Pedrables road, about 500 metres, the Finca Guell is on the left side of the road. And if you would like to shake hand with Gaudi, just turn right from Finca Guell and walked about 1 km, you could see him there, his statue!
