In fact, we came across this sight on our way to the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. The monument is named after the 19th century Catalan-language epic poet of the Jacint Verdaguer. The small plaza is crowned by a noucentista statue made in 1912 by Joan Borrell of Verdaguer on top of a tall column. The landmark was designed by the architect Josep Maria Peric\u00e0s with Borrell's morals of poetry. The bas-reliefs around the monument, featuring scenes from Verdaguer's works, were sculpted by the brothers Lluci\u00e0 and Miquel Osl\u00e9. We would not go out of our way to search out this monument, but it was interesting to see, since it was along the route of our self-guided tour anyway.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-17", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 676521522, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d9570964-r676521522-Buho_de_la_Plaza_Jacint_Verdaguer-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This is a huge \"sculpture\" of an owl, on top of the building across the road, probably an advertising thing? Some reviews on this page have confused the heading entry Buho de la Plaza Jacint Verdaguer, with the Monument of Jacint Verdaguer, which is in the middle of the roundabout. Buho refers to the Owl! You will see it if you turn your gaze upwards towards the other direction and keep looking, until you spot the giant owl.
