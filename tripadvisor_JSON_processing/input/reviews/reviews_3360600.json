At least you can relate to the buildings you see on this 3D film and discover the amazing  imagination of Gaudi and how he came up with his creation. .The 3D film basically takes you through his mind as he was creating so you have to sit back relax, fasten your seat belt and enjoy every second.

There's a gift shop outside the theatre with touch screens with information about Gaudi on. Yes, you could maybe spend a good hour looking at these, but there was just so much information on, no tourist is going to read through everything. It was basically a Wikipedia page just copy pasted onto some fancy looking touch screens. \n\nAs for the actual 4D film, completely overrated. I can see people with kids maybe wanting to come as it might keep them entertained, but it gave absolutely zero information about Gaudi and definitely didn't take you into his world. After visiting La Sagrada Familia and there being a museum part with so much interesting stuff about Gaudi being inspired by nature, it really made you wonder what whoever made the Gaudi Experience film was on. The film compromised of an actor playing Gaudi sat at a desk drawing and then his buildings morphed into knights and dragons and it just descended into an elaborate fight scene between the two. No information about his architecture or what inspired him really was shown.
