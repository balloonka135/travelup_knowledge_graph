Seats are comfortable and spacious enough. Athough seat rows are positioned quite flat you can still get proper views pretty much from anywhere, including first floor and side seats, unless you are unlucky to get someone taller than you in the row in front of yours.\n\nThis time we were attending \"La gran ilusion\" by the magician Mago Pop. For such type of shows, where you want to see what the magician is doing with his hands (other type of shows might apply too), I strongly suggest not to seat beyond row 15. We were sitting at row 19 and, although nothing was blocking our vision, we missed details of the show because we were clearly too far. If, on top, you consider that my seats (and the ones behind) cost the same as the ones in the front (a bit above 30\u20ac per seat, no matter if you are children or grown up), then I must admit I left a bit disappointed.\n\nThe show is pretty good, although pretty short though (less than 1h). \n\nConsidering what we paid and the seats we got, I can not provide more than 3 stars. I was thinking of 2 stars actually, but my kids were so amused with the tricks that I allow one more star.", "publishedDate": "2016-09-18", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 300549025, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7106610-r300549025-Tivoli_Theatre-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Teatro Tivoli offers outstanding price/value and attracts some great shows. \nThe seats are rather comfy, sound pretty good, friendly and helpful staff and well located. \nDon'y hesitate for a moment - go for it.

Even though it was free I never imagined a line around the block. Apparently with the mass email, a write up in the paper and a Facebook notice, half of the western 'burbs came out. They have done tours before and never had quite the turn out.\n\nUnfortunately we never got the full tour because of the crowd. While waiting in line for almost two hours in the sun the staff brought out water and kept us up to date of the situation. When we got near the door they realized that we were not going to get in even after they extended the number of tours.", "publishedDate": "2015-04-08", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
