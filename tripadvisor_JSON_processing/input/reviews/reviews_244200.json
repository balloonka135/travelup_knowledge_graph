The medieval shipyard interactive displays got me thinking about how to organise a shipyard (in their time shipyards were the apex of industrial organisation so anyone interested in the history of factories or organisation of labour would find plenty to think about here)\n\nMy only criticism is that the arrangements of the exhibits seemed pretty random to me.  The route I took left me looking at a medieval shipyard one moment, then exhibits related to slavery and steam power, then modern containerisation, then a galley from Lepanto.\n\nThe way it is laid out may appeal to more sophisticated museum goers who don't like being spoon fed. However for me personally I appreciate some structure or unfolding narrative as I go around a museum so I have an historical context for the developments I am looking at, and can see how the changes built upon each other.\n\nIn summary,  a lot of effort had gone into the individual exhibits but perhaps not so much into the overall organisation.", "publishedDate": "2019-10-14", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 717947806, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244200-r717947806-Museu_Maritim_de_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We found the Maritime museum very interesting - the story of shipbuilding and its relation to the economic success of Barcelona, really only gets told here.

The buildings that houses the Naval Museum were once the Royal Shipyard. It is obvious the total work that was done to restore the building, with excellent results. I think it is a valuable contribution of the Museum to highlight the maritime history of Spain and especially of Catalonia - Barcelona.\nThe ticket costs \u20ac10 per person. Your visit can include the sailing ship which is in the port, a few hundred meters further.   (Schooner Santa Eulalia). It sound strange but in the Christian Orthodox religion, she is the same Santa Eulalia [(the person with blessed speech )\u2013[ E\u03c5 = \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc ( in Greek  is the word Good)  + \u03bb\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce = speak , in Greek ) ]that in the age of 12 the young girl, became a martyr for the faith of Christ, chased as a Christian by the envoys of the Roman Empire, even today Eulalia is the patron and protector of the city of Barcelona. The Greek Orthodox Church honours the memory of the Santa, on 22th of August. \nAt the entrance of the Museum (in the garden) there is a wooden submarine, and an old crane for unloading the ships, as outdoor exhibits. \nI suggest to follow the correct direction for your personal tour, having the electronic guide device with headphones. It all starts with your entry in a projection room to watch a short film about the naval history of Spain. The door closes automatically and the next visitors will have to wait the specified time of the next presentation (view). Watching the movie, which is very believable, perceived the importance of navigation and exploration and contribution to the New World. With the end of the film, another door opens in opposite direction, in order to continue your visit. You will notice the giant Royal Galley (a replica), oars in actual size, also an electronic simulation device, that give the real idea of the hard motion of oars, noting how difficult life was of rowers. Try to move it alone! You can realise that you must synchronize with other rowers, to have a result! The Galley (1571) even is a replica, present the real ship with all magnificent design and decoration mainly in the part of the Stern. A special scale model give the complete picture of the Royal Galley, the Flagship of the Fleet of the Holy League at the Battle of Lepanto in which the Turkish Armada was defeated. (8-10-1771).\n\nThere is a restaurant and Caf\u00e9, inside the Museum, also outside there is a garden with beautiful fountain, as extension of the Caf\u00e9 for smokers also. The area is well cared. A good choice for a brake, after the tour in the Museum.\nThere is a souvenir shop, with many souvenirs at reasonable prices. The best nautical souvenirs are between \u20ac30-\u20ac200. The rest of the objects are the classic children\u2019s or cheap souvenirs. My suggestion would be considered by the Museum, the possibility of the production, by order, issues from naval history, in magnets for the refrigerator, as is the case with the other Museums of Barcelona. It takes imagination and creativity, something that exists in Barcelona and it is obvious at each step around the city.\nCongratulation to the people that worked for this project. The staff that worked, it certainly worked very hard to present the naval history of Spain and especially of Barcelona.\nHighly recommended, especially during the morning hours, where the temperature in the summer months is high. There are many lockers to leave your packs, during the visiting. You can take photos without any problem.
