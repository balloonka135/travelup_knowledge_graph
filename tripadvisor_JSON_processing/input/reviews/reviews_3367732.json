There was a sports meet in the outside pool, so I could only swim in the indoor pool.  The ticket attendant was not friendly; entry costs about 12\u20ac; you must wear a swim cap in the pool and you need your own lock for the lockers (you can buy a lock for 12\u20ac in the little shop by the ticket seller).   There are two men's locker rooms - one near the pool, and another one downstairs closer to the gym.  Curiously, there are very few bathrooms; none in the pool locker room, but a single men's stall (plus a women's and a handicapped) adjacent to the pool deck.  The indoor pool was divided into 20 (or more) 25 metre lanes which two people shared- mostly side-by-side swimming, not circles.  There are two sweep-second (analog) swim pace clocks - one at each end of the pool (near the big windows, so if you are anywhere near the middle the clocks are distant and hard to read).  There are no digital timers. Some lanes are reserved for seniors.  If you do backstroke, there are no flags - however, the ceiling design changes at the pool edge, so it's not a problem.  Borrow various pull-buoys, kick boards, flotation tubes, etc. on deck.  I could see only a single (friendly) lifeguard watching over the entire enormous space.  The tiny pool-deck jacuzzi fits about four people, and the water is not hot.  Many people left towels and bags hanging on hooks on the side of the pool; most left flip-flops at the end of their lane.

I swim regularly and significantly as a matter of course, so my expectations were more than just a 'splash around'.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the two fifty metre pools more than fulfilled this expectation.  As it happened, I only used the outdoor pool, simply because the chance to swim outdoors living in the United Kingdom is such a rarity.  This pool was mostly set-up for lane swimming, although had some well-bounded areas for informal swimming.  Everyone kept to the appropriate areas, meaning that productive swimming was certainly possible.\n\nSwimming in such an important pool historically in inherently a pleasure, but doubly so when the weather is warm, the sun is shining and the sky is blue.\n\nThe entrance price is not super-cheap, being a little over \u20ac11, but this seemed to be for a day ticket.  Changing and other facilities were orderly, clean and in good repair.  Pleasantly they seemed largely the original style as when the facility was refurbished and expanded for the 1992 Olympics, so this have some added interest to the venue.  The indoor pool also seemed good, while beside the outdoor pool was a square pool which was quite deep, which is likely for water polo.\n\nA padlock is required for the lockers which users must bring themselves.  However, it is possible to leave non-valuables out, such as towels, clothes and shoes beside the pool.  I visited at 18:30 on a Saturday and there was significant available space, but it was likely busier at an earlier time in the day.", "publishedDate": "2016-07-24", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 391425003, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d3367732-r391425003-Piscines_Bernat_Picornell-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This is a wonderful lap pool and play pool.

The indoor pool looked clean and well looked after and was busy whenever I went. The outdoor pool has fewer users, especially outside July and August. But it is a lovely swimming pool, open all year round, well maintained and with friendly lifeguards. It's great to swim in an actual Olympic pool, especially when it's outside in the Mediterranean sunshine. The changing facilities are excellent and include a jacuzzi. I dropped a star for two reasons: firstly I wish it opened a bit earlier - I like to swim before breakfast but you can't get in before 9.30 (even later on Sundays and in the winter). The only real criticism I have is that it's bizarrely difficult to get to the caf\u00e9 from the pool. It is a nice caf\u00e9 with a balcony over the pool and a good selection of refreshments.It's open to the public and is easy to get to from the outside, but has no direct access to the pools or gym. We managed to get there only by going through a barrier which we probably weren't meant to be able to pass - it was a quiet day and few staff were around!

Usually they are too short and crowded for laps.  I've found that access to local pools is a better option for working out as a traveler.  Being from the northeastern US, year round pools are all  indoors and usually not more than 25 yards or meters long; so outdoor pools and long distances are a big draw for me.\n\nHaving executed the 'swim at public pool' philosophy in Kona, Kihei, Palm Desert, and Munich, I had to experience the Piscines Bernat Picornell while in Barcelona.  \n\nWe went on a Thursday afternoon, paid around eight euros for access to the facilities.  The W's locker room entrance is on a higher level than the Olympic pool, and at about the same level as an indoor pool.  Signage is all in Spanish or Catalan, so its a guessing game to figure out what is behind the many locker room doors once you've stowed your stuff.  None that I tried led to toilets, however, which was weird.  \n\nThe locker room is pretty wide open, Euro style, as are the showers, so if you expect privacy, you should adjust expectations.  Showers operate with a push on the knob and run for a few minutes before shutting off...\n\nI chose the Olympic pool, since it was a beautiful sunny day and an opportunity to swim 50m laps outdoors should not be passed on, imo.  The water was colder than I expected, extremely clear, and eventually pretty comfortable, once I had finished a couple of  laps. The pool is deep everywhere (per Olympic standard), with a ledge on the ends for standing between laps.  I didn't see anyone using the diving well, but it appeared to be open, as it wasn't roped off. \n\nOn this Thursday afternoon, there were always a few open lanes, with one side set  up as a wide (3 widths) lane.  The indoor pool, visible from an upstairs concession, looked about 50m long, but was set up for short course, with maybe 15 lanes available.\n\nBack at the Olympic pool, chaise lounges were lined up on the sunny side, not all occupied.  Some women were sunbathing topless, but I didn't see anyone nude or swimming without a suit.\n\nOverall, I loved it, and I thought it was as good as any other city's facilities I've tried.
