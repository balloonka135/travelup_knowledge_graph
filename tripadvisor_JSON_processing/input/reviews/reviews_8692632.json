It is a privilege that the guild opened their house to the public. This guided tour is like a time travel. There are just a few rooms to view but each with interesting objects to discover. I highly recommend this tour to the sophisticated traveler who want to discover Barcelona outside of the mainstream. And the best of all is the very simpatico tour guide, if you are lucky you gonna meet Laura and she will infect you with her passion. The 10 EUR fee are absolutely justified.", "publishedDate": "2016-09-24", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 421510087, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8692632-r421510087-La_Casa_de_la_Seda_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "New open house to visit in Barcelona only available on 2016 for tourists. Good location in the city center, few people because it\u00b4s not well known from the public. the guide was nice! the visit took 50 minuts and it\u00b4s a beautiful house. Happy to see everything with no rush. The only negative thing it\u00b4s too expensive for the offer (small house).

This is very close to the Museo de la Musica, just around the corner. The guide was extremely knowledgable. It helped to learn about the history of the guilds, to understand commerce and how Barcelona came to be such a powerful port in it's time. We were shown beautiful examples from the silk makers of tapestry and wallpaper design. This was a fascinating experience! It is the only guildhouse open to the public in Barcelona.
