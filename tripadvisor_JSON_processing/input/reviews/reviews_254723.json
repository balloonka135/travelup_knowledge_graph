What we truly enjoyed was the tremendous old architecture all along Passeig de Gracia representing artists such as Antoni Gaud\u00ed, Pere Falqu\u00e9s, Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, Enric Sagnier and Josep Vilaseca.

If you visit Barcelona, you must walk up and down this beautiful road, that runs from Pla\u00e7a Catalunya to Carrer Gran de Gr\u00e0cia. There are lots of things to see and do at Paseo de Gracia, including shopping at the most elegant stores in the city.\n\nRight on Paseo de Gracia you will find some of the most beautiful and famous buildings in Barcelona: Casa La Pedrera and Casa Battl\u00f3 (both built by Antoni Gaudi), Casa Amatller (by Josep Puig I Cadafalch), Casa Lle\u00f3 Morera (by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech I Montaner). Each building is a work of art of a different famous architect. If you have enough time, visiting the inside of these historical landmarks, learning about Modernism, about these architects and about the history of Barcelona is incredibly interesting. \n\nAs you walk through this boulevard, you will encounter countless gorgeous details everywhere. While you shop in the most elegant stores, at the same time you will be able to find incredible paintings, sculptures, staircases, stained glass windows, woodwork and all types of ornaments everywhere.\n\nFor example, the walls at the entrance of Lacoste feature the carved artwork of sculptor Frederic Mar\u00e8s. Loewe is located at Casa Lle\u00f3 Morera, a historical building with a very ornamented facade and a very recognizable tempietto on top of the roof. At Palau Malagrida, built by architect Joaquim Codina I Matal\u00ed, you will find Anthropologie, and if you pay attention, you will see the beautiful details of the building at the entrance of the store. When visiting Uniqlo, be careful to see the staircase, the colorful stained glass windows and the lamp. Inside and outside, these emblematic buildings are stunning.\n\nAt Paseo de Gracia you will also find luxury hotels such as the Condes de Barcelona and the Mandarin Oriental (as you approach the Mandarin you will be welcomed, for a short time, by a large bright Blue Gorilla by Richard Orlinski).\n\nAt the intersection of Paseo de Gracia and Gran Via des Corts Catalans, you will see a beautiful fountain, the Fuente Monumental, which is decorated with lights during the night.\n\nI think that in every visit to Barcelona, you must find time, at least, for a short stroll at Paseo de Gracia.
