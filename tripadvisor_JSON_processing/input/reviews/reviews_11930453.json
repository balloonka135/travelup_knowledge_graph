The Roman goddess of fruitful abundance is depicted with braided hair and wearing a low cut sheer garment. Like a scarf, she wears a branch full of fruit around her shoulders, falling down past her left hip. Her right hand is held up, palm open, in a gesture of victory. Her left hand is held in, the tips of her fingers touching the front of her right shoulder, in a very feminine gesture.\n\nThe sculpture can be easy to miss. It\u2019s located at the entranceway on the south side of the Plaza and opposite Deutsche Bank, behind the sculpture of a shepherd and eagle.\n\nIt\u2019s one of many statues in the plaza. It\u2019s okay, I wouldn\u2019t go out of the way to see it though.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-15", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 676527279, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d11930453-r676527279-Pomona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Pomona is a small bronze sculpture in Plaza de Catalunya.
