Many good concerts are held there all year round. Before I go to Barcelona, I always check what's on there. Last year, I went to 2 concerts there which were held in Salas 2 and 3 (not the main auditorium). This time, before I went, I noticed that Johann Johansson was having a one night only concert there and I was thrilled. I went. It was held in Sala 1 (so I got to see the main auditorium as well). It was a wonderful concert. Sadly, Johann Johansson passed away 10 days later. The world has lost a great talent. I would not forget this opportunity I had.\nIf you are a music lover, don't forget to check out the programmes there.", "publishedDate": "2018-03-12", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 545650224, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244897-r545650224-L_Auditori-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This hall must be seriously destroyed by the city of Barcelona and rebuilt from the ground up. I've been to bad concert halls before, but unfortunately L'auditori tops my list. As soon as the clapping began prior to the concert, you could tell this hall is just painfully saturated, with penetrating trebles, barely inaudible mids and completely one-hundred-percent muted lows. All players playing to a bass clef were just for show\u2014and you hear that from a classical composer's point of view, with still excellent hearing. It really felt not much different than listening to music through tiny phone speakers, including the lack of \"body\" or warmth to the music, and plenty of inaudible parts. If that was not enough, in quiet parts, the A/C noise sadly overcame the music. Other than that, seats were OK, staff was helpful and toilets were clean.", "publishedDate": "2017-12-06", "language": "en", "rating": 1}, {"id": 533585633, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244897-r533585633-L_Auditori-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I cant belive such a place exists in barcelona... but once you are inside everything changes... nice place to listen to some great orchestra... downpoints... everything is in catalan... and the architecture of the place... music, organization and seats... excellent!!", "publishedDate": "2017-10-16", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 367161530, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244897-r367161530-L_Auditori-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "went to a classical in this wonderful building and had a really good evening Booked the concert on line, the tickets were waiting for us at the booking office.

It's principal use appears to be for classical music, which I would guess would be great at this venue but I attended a 'Chicago' concert (probably the best band in the world).  Not having been before I selected one of the most expensive seats, right in front of the band about 11 rows back.  However, the design is such that the upper floors, boxes and lateral seating all have great views of the stage.

But if to rate it among European musical halls then it's a 3/5. Very mediocre. Acoustics and sound could have been worse, but there're nothing good I can say about it. If there is an orchestra, you can hear them quite well, but the piano doesn't sound loud enough. Make sure you sit in the lower amphitheater - it's the best. I've been there three times, and I liked it most of all. Avoid the upper levels though, because it's very bad.", "publishedDate": "2010-06-01", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
