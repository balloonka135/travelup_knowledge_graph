The show at 21.30 is sort of a warm up for the big show at midnight. This year, the show was a mix of water, fire and fireworks, really impressive (not as in size but more as an artistic display). There was a huge crowd, so after the main show at midnight was over, you had to be patient if you wanna leave. There was Police everywhere, however they were very polite. There were people in the crowd selling  small bags of 12 grapes for you to mark the tradition and even six-packs of beer/ juice/ champagne. The amazing thing was that in the morning, I passed the Plaza again and I could see lots of \"sanitation engineers\" power washing the plaza in the morning so you couldn't even tell that at midnight there were broken gasses/champagne left over from the celebration (big thumbs up for the administration)", "publishedDate": "2020-01-13", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 737602520, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d591343-r737602520-Placa_d_Espanya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This is a must see in Barcelona, but once you are there you do not need to spend much time here as the heavy traffic takes away from the beauty of the place.

The place is packed with people and I wish I'd set off to the celebrations a little earlier but I still managed to squeeze into a central place for the countdown & fireworks! It was magical with the ball drop, light projections, fireworks & lots of people taking part in the traditional eating of a grape per chime at midnight - lovely community feel. \n\nAlcohol was allowed on the night, although for safety reasons people were having glass bottles taken away/ decanted into plastic cups.\n\nTop Tip: Plan ahead, if you want to take part in a midnight toast or traditional grape eating, take your things with you. Many people sell refreshments at the event but at extortionate rates and for the most part are not official vendors.", "publishedDate": "2019-01-12", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
