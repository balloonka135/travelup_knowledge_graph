You can get up into the hills the tourist way by taking the Metro L7 to Avinguda Tibidabo at Kennedy Plaza, then the heritage Tramvia Blau (Blue Streetcar, 5.50 euros one way), then the Tibidabo Funicular (7.70 euros one way), and finally the Minibus 111. A cheaper option is taking the commuter train S1 or S2 to Peu del Funicular, then the Vallvidrera Funicular, and finally the Minibus 111 in the other direction (all with regular transit tickets like the T10). \n\nFrom the bus stop it's a short walk down a path away from the mountain road. It leads past the subterranean entrance to the tower. You buy a ticket and wait for a spell for more visitors to arrive and a guard to take the group up by glass elevator (not for anyone with no head for heights). \n\nThe views from the observation deck stretch across Barcelona to the Mediterranean and in the other direction to Montserrat. The only problem is that there is a gap between the deck and the facade (with a balustrade, of course), so you can't get close to the windows and always have window frames in your photos. \n\nAll in all probably the best panorama of Barcelona, if a little off the tourist path. At that point, a half-hour or an hour before closing time, there were only two or three visitors up there. But if you have some time left, it's well worth doing. You can combine it with visits to the Sagrat Cor and the Tibidabo Amusement Park (via Minibus 111).", "publishedDate": "2017-06-08", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 478042071, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2321733-r478042071-Torre_de_Collserola-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This communications tower dominates the landscape of this beautiful city.
