Designed  by the Jaume Torres i Grau, the building is very much in Noucentisme architectural style then in vogue as a reaction to the perceived ubiquity that Catalan Modernism had become.

The different plants are differentiated into five different classes. The mezzanine floors from the 2nd up each have very attractive balconies with forged railings to complete the facade.\n\n Worth a detour if in the area.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-15", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
