We rented an apartment near the market. Its the opposite of the Boqueria Market off the ramblas. Very clean and modern although i must say the Boqueria has that 'old school'and 'haphazard' charm about it.  At sant antoni you must go to a premade food stall that seems to be run by two sisters.  You will find an array of great food to go.  We had paella at several restaurants and this was the best. The white beans with parsely and tomatoes was great.  We bought a few containers of food and some great fruit , picked up a bottle of wine (5\u20ac) and a bottle of Cava(3\u20ac) at Condis (chain grocery store) and had a superb meal back at the apartment. Most of the people shopping here seem to be locals with few tourists. Very few owners spoke english but you can point and use hand signals and they serve you. They are not catering to tourists. So visit several markets around barcelona, they all have their unique charm....but be up to date on the hours of operation.", "publishedDate": "2018-09-05", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 594907144, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4660265-r594907144-Mercat_De_Sant_Antoni-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Those expecting a typical market experience should look elsewhere.
