Italian and German airplanes for the first time in history bombed civilian targets -- massive sustained air attacks against the people and city of Barcelona.\n\nHere, on the side of Montjuic, the people of Barcelona built an air raid shelter in the rock of the mountain. The government, under attack was not able to build sufficient shelters for the population. Italian aircraft were bombing the city from the island of Mallorca, and Barcelona had no advance warning of the coming attacks. People had 2-3 minutes advance notice of the attacks. Shelters were needed in all neighborhoods of the city. The result is that the government distributed picks and axes, and gave out plans for the construction of shelters. Community associations, trade unions, social clubs, athletic clubs, churches all pitched in, building shelters, which the government then inspected to make sure they were up to standards and deep enough to withstand attacks.\n\nThe deep roots of Catalonian self-administration, distrust of government and anarchism are evident in the reality that more than two thousand such shelters were built in Barcelona - built by the people and their organizations, not by the government. Refugi 307 is one of the few tunnels that is preserved to this day.\n\nThe museum is open to the public only on Sundays. English language tour is at 10:30. Others tours in Catalan and Spanish. This is the only way for individuals to visit. Pre-registration is required. Visit http://museuhistoria.bcn.cat/en/node/661 .
