As expected, this is a massive complex which includes a stadium, sports hall and swimming pools.

I was surprised to learn that it is actually a communications tower that obviously was indispensable in the Summer of 1992. \n\nI learned that the complex is currently used for special events.

Remember use the bathrooms at the stadium because they are far and few between.  You can also get refreshments inside at a stand and there is small gift shop.  Good phots to be had overlooking field and then outside by other complexes.

Walk up to Palau National, every time I went the museum was closed, but it\u2019s very nice to relax listening to street artists \u2013 remember to look for the board advertising the timing for the Magic fountain! \n- After this there is the Anella Olympica\n- Nearby there is also Miro museum if you are into art\n- After that you\u2019ll find the Montjuic castle with its stunning views\n\nIf you want to stay in the area for the evening too, then there are two popular choices:\n- See the Magic fountain show (check days and times!) \u2013 this is between Placa d\u2019Espanya and Palau National\n- Or maybe book El Tablao de Carmen for some tapas and lovely flamenco show \u2013 in the Poble Espaniol (Spanish quarter)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-06", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 136707783, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d265457-r136707783-Anella_Olimpica-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "A place nice to visit, large areas, many fountains, close to bothanical gardens, great view to Montjuic and the city.", "publishedDate": "2012-08-09", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
