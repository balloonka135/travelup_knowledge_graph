Beside the \"La Sagrada Familia\", both cathedrals are very beautiful and impressive. \nAlready from the architecture it is an imposing building, worth to visit, even when not religious. It is definitely worth a visit.\n\nSanta Maria del Mar is a Gothic church, with a purity and uniformity of style that is otherwise unusual for large medieval buildings.\nWith its monumental towers, the church looks like a fortress from the outside. This is also due to the early period when the church was built, in the 14th century. In contrast to the facade, with the narrow streets, the interior gives the impression of spaciousness. It corresponds to the basilica type, with three naves that form a single room without transept. There is no architectural boundary between the main nave and the presbytery. Worth seeing is the concentration of the vault load on a few points, so that the simple rib vault of the main nave is supported by only four slim, octagonal columns.\nThe interior, with its 3 naves, shines wonderfully in the sunlight and is impressively designed with many decorations and with a lot of love for details. \n\nA tour of the church, a possibility, but not a must. However, in addition to interesting stories about the construction, the tour also offers the possibility of a spectacular view from the roof.\n\nVery worthwhile! A clear recommendation!\nAnd as with everything in Barcelona, \u200b\u200border tickets online.
