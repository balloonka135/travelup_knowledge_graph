Also bottles and other vessels for perfumes, ointments and incense from ancient Greece, ancient Egypt, Japan, etc. It's in the back of a perfume store, so if you're inspired you can buy some perfume of your own. I like small quirky museums and I like perfume and I was staying at a guesthouse across the street, so this was a very nice way to spend about 45 minutes.

You enter through a perfume shop.  This little gem is located in the back.  The clerk was friendly and turned on the lights, leaving us alone to explore at our leisure.

I was really looking forward to this and we hunted it out but the whole experience was disappointing. We had to wait a while to buy a ticket to the museum which is located at the back of a store that is not welcoming at all. The lady took our 10 euro (it's 5 euro entry per person) and told us which perfumes we could smell. There are only a few available to smell which is understandable given most of them are old and locked behind glass. Expect to see lots of bottles and there is no information relating to the history. We managed to find a brochure on a stand but it was just a general overview. This has the potential to be a really cool place to visit but it needs a multi-lingual guide or audio guide to make it meaningful. You do get a discount in the shop afterwards if you choose to buy it but we didn't connect with the store at all. Staff were disinterested and avoided making eye contact with us as we left the museum. We did purchase from a fabulous perfumery called The Perfumery located at Baixada de Santa Eul\u00e0lia, 3, 08002 Barcelona, Spain so would recommend here if you are looking to buy a scent. Les Topettes, Carrer de Joaqu\u00edn Costa, 33, 08001 Barcelona, also offered a different style of scents and great service", "publishedDate": "2017-10-06", "language": "en", "rating": 1}, {"id": 495226500, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2218960-r495226500-Museo_del_Perfume_Museum_of_Perfume-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This was located very close to our hotel, so we stopped in to check it out.
