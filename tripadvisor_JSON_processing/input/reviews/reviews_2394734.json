The country, the city, the beautiful garden and of course, the ring. She didn't see it coming, but I had it planned for months. \n\nI had been going back and forth with my photographer for weeks on deciding the perfect location for my surprise proposal. I wanted a quiet place with a beautiful setting and backdrop. I'm so happy I picked this place as I could not see it beforehand. Coming from the USA, all I had was the internet and social media as my set of eyes.\n\nThe park itself costs roughly $3 per person to get in and it's worth every penny. The gardens are exquisite, the labyrinth was fun and the flowers were in perfect bloom.\n\nWithout giving away all the details of this cozy park, I would mark it off as a must-do when in Barcelona.
