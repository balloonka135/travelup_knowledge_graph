The building is located on the corner of Carrer del Consell de Cent, and is one of the three important buildings of Barcelona's Illa de la Disc\u00f2rdia (\"Block of Discord\"), and it is the only building of the block awarded Barcelona's town council's Arts Building Annual Award (Concurso anual de edificios art\u00edsticos), obtained in 1906.[1] The building lost some of its most representative elements, such as the tempietto on its top (now restored) and the ground floor and mezzanine's architectural sculpture.[2] The building is also known as the residence of Cuban-Catalan photographer Pau Audouard.[3]\n\nContents\n1\tThe building\n2\tGallery\n3\tSee also\n4\tReferences\n5\tExternal links\nThe building[edit]\nThe building was not only the result of an architectural project, but \u2014common practice in Catalan modernism architecture\u2014, several artists collaborated with Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner so as to make a complete artwork, inspired in natural and organic motifs: Llu\u00eds Bru and Mario Maragliano were responsible of the mosaic work, Eusebi Arnau made the sculptures, Antoni Serra i Fiter elaborated the ceramics, and Gaspar Homar designed the decoration and the furniture.[4]\n\nIt has been considered that Morera's family wanted to leave trace of their lineage with the continuous references to their family name (Morera, which means mulberry tree in English) in the decoration. Some examples are the mulberry tree found in the patio, the mulberry motifs of the door handles or the portraits made by Antoni Serra in the second floor. The fa\u00e7ade and ground floor of the building are decorated with big and varied modernist ornaments, with some outstanding sculptures by Eusebi Arnau surrounding the entrance, which represent two couples of feminine figures holding vases. Those sculptures are installed on double pairs of columns made of pink marble, and under the gallery of the first floor, other feminine heads can be found. The building has been considered one of the best examples of modernism architecture and definitely should be seen.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-17", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 690237101, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244195-r690237101-Casa_Lleo_i_Morera-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Casa Lleo I Morera is one of the many stunning buildings located at Passeig de Gracia. \n\nCasa Lle\u00f3 Morera is the work of Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech I Montaner, and it has a long and interesting history.

You can get a combined ticket with the Casa Amatller in the same block for 21 euros which is great value. It is worthwhile when exploring Gaudi's buildings nearby (Casa Batllo & La Pedrera) to get a sense of the context within which he was working by visiting buildings by his Modernista architect contemporaries. \nThis building had no expense spared, pink marble extensively used in the front rooms & the stained glass in the dining room overlooking the rear terrace is wonderful.
