It is the seat of the Government of Catalonia and the Presidency of the Generalitat.\n\nWhile you're standing on the square outside the Generalitat, look closely at the facade of the City Hall and you\u2019ll see a sculpture of St George and the Dragon, a tale that has been passed down for generations in the Catalan folklore. I had found this story fascinating. Legend has it, and I\u2019m paraphrasing quite a bit, is that the city was once terrorised by a dragon and the King offered up the princess as a blood sacrifice to save the people. So happened that on the day of the sacrifice, St George happened to rode by and decided to save the princess by slaying the dragon. The story takes so much prominence in Barcelona that the people actually celebrates St George\u2019s Day, which is actually their version of Valentine\u2019s Day. Do notice as you visit around Barcelona that the dragon motif featured prominently across the city. If I didn\u2019t head the story in the first place, I would have completely missed interesting nugget.", "publishedDate": "2016-04-17", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 357644937, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4597992-r357644937-Palau_De_La_Generalitat_De_Catalunya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This is a visit which needs to be pre booked beforehand on the Generalitat web site. We had to make contact twice before we got a reply, when we did it was very helpful. Check the visiting schedule as it is very limited and when we visited the only languages were Castillian or Catalan. \nThe tour starts of with an auditorium presentation before you head of into the building proper, which is beautiful, only wish we could have followed the narration. One point -  the numerous St George and the dragon statues and images which being English seems odd to us as we think of him as our patron saint.\nMany thanks to the Generalitat for making this visit available and to the wonderful guide on the 13 Mar.\n  ", "publishedDate": "2016-03-22", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 340660000, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4597992-r340660000-Palau_De_La_Generalitat_De_Catalunya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The Presidential Palace of Catalonia is a medieval building at Placa de Saint Jaume square, opposite the Barcelona City Hall.

The rooms where they both used to, \nand still do govern from are magnificent, as is the staircase.

Tours are at limited weekends only (I think the 3rd weekend in the month except August)  and need to be booked through the office of the Generalitat. This is complicated as it requires a Spanish National ID but I managed to get on a tour by emailing the Catalan President's office. It is much easier to visit the City Hall opposite (this is by audio guide) and there are similarities between the building's interiors. Both are free.\nUnfortunately the tours were only in Catalan or Spanish on the day I visited in February but there may be English tours in other months. Luckily the kind guide took time to sum up every room with me in her fluent English. She made the building come alive in the context of the Catalan people's historic struggles. There are some fine art pieces from all eras and interesting architectural contrasts and use of form to facilitate it's function as the totem of the Catalan people's struggle for self determination. The tour is 2 hours and you need to bring the official invite with you plus ID and arrive ahead of time.", "publishedDate": "2014-06-27", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 180841855, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4597992-r180841855-Palau_De_La_Generalitat_De_Catalunya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I went there on my last day in Barcelona just to look at the local shops.
