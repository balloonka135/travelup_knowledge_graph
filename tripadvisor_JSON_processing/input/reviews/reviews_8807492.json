This building is the work of Jeroni Ferran Granell i Manresa. While not on the monumental scale of the likes of Casa Mila, Casa Batllo or Casa de les Punxes et al, it has many elements of Modernism that makes it and attractive building. The design of the facade is highly symmetric with pretty green sgraffito of floral designs, bay windows that forms a continuim from the first to the third floor.  The cornice on the roof is instantly recognisable for anyone who has seem typical work of modernist buildings and is a beautiful multi-coloured of curved lines. The balconies on either side of the bay windows are pretty wrought iron in the style of Art Nouveau.\n\nNot a must see like the monumental works of Modernism, only worth a quick detour if close by.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-14", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 622625873, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8807492-r622625873-Casa_Granell-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We came across this small restaurant and I must say I'm glad we did! Food was delicious, especially the baguettes we ate, so good in fact that we bought one most days when we visited the beach which was everyday. The owner was very accommodating and pleasant and I would definitely recommend this place.", "publishedDate": "2018-10-06", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
