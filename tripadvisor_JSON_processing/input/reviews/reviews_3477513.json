But operations leave space for improvement:\nPros\nAutobelays; nice tall walls for sport climbing (lead only) plus some bouldering\nCons\nVery inconvenient location a significant amount of walking from nearest metro; hidden in an alley and hard to find; staff doesn't speak a word of English (btw I'm not a native speaker so this isn't colonialism); unfriendly couldn't give a damn staff; filthy bathrooms; water pooling on floor in parts of gym making a hazard (no one bothered with it); routes are inconsistently graded (boulders ok, ropes very sandbagged); little variety in climbing style featuring mostly slopers in the autobelay section; no wifi\n\nWhat made the worst impression was when I asked to access wifi to call a cab. Instead of offering to let me use their phone, they sent me to walk alone at night down a dark alley in unfamiliar territory. I hope the management sacks these uncaring aholes.\n", "publishedDate": "2018-09-08", "language": "en", "rating": 1}, {"id": 275948361, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d3477513-r275948361-CEM_Climbat_La_Foixarda-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "As a solo traveler, the auto-belays were handy and allowed me to practice climbing by myself.\n\nBooked a guide for some private training which was nice. I am a 5+/6a climber. \n\nThey could have changed the holds more often, the walls had a bit of a run-down feel to them.\n\nWas there in May and not many people in the center.
