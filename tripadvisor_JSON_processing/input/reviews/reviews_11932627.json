He main legacy was the creation of an industrial conglomerate, Tous, Ascac\u00edbar and Compa\u00f1\u00eda that specialised in casting iron and the construction of heavy machinery for the textile industry. Oddly for an economist, he advocated protectionism, but maybe that\u2019s a good thing if it\u2019s protectionism for Catalan businesses from his point of view. Who knows.\n\nThis monument sits on the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanas, at the western end of Jardins de la Reina Victoria. The monument stands16 meters high, is crowned by a bronze sculpture of Joan G\u00fcell. The sculpture stands atop a square pedestal with relief sculptures on three sides. The front is engraved with his name and family crest. The other three sides depict sculptures representing allegories of agriculture, trade and industry.\n\nNothing amazing.
