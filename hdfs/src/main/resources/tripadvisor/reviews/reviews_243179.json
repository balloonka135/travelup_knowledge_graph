Heavingly full from when it opens at 7pm for the evening diners. We arrived at 7.15 and it was almost impossible to move let alone get a seat. On our visit there we sat and chatted with Belgian, American, Spanish and a variety of other nationalities who had all had this place recommended to them. The evening was not cheap but the tapas were absolutely beautiful and the Rioja was excellent!
