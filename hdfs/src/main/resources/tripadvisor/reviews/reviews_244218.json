In each of these areas you will find an immersive audiovisual space with which you will enter the traditions, gastronomy and landscapes of the area where you are.  The builders wanted to recreate in Montju\u00efc the 'ideal Spanish town'. And for that, they toured 1,600 towns across the country.

The park featured building styles from all over Spain and it is indeed quite nice to walk through the streets and feeling like you're in the countrysides of Spain. All the buildings features a gift shop/restaurant at the first level, which makes a sort of a giant mall, but nobody is standing outside to sell anything, so it's \"go in if you'd like\".  There's an area where you'll see the panoramic view of Barcelona at the top of the hill, it's quite nice. We had a good time strolling around.
