It\u2019s a study of the female form, life sized in white, and depicts a nude woman, seated with her knees drawn up and resting on on a square marble plinth. Her right elbow is resting on her left knee and she rests her check against the back of her hand. The one her in Placa de Catalunya is actually a copy of the original which is displayed in Casa de la Ciudad de Barcelona.\n\nThe sculpture exudes sensuality and classical beauty. The simple and delicate features of the figure evoking a feeling of serenity. Definitely worth seeking out if in the area.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-15", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 676468692, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d11930450-r676468692-La_Deessa-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "La Deessa o l\u2019Enigma\u2019 is a beautiful, white marble sculpture by Josep Clara, in Plaza de Catalunya.

As I circled the monument, I discovered that it formed a backdrop to this white marble creation, placed in the middle of a shallow circular pool. The work depicts a nude woman on a low pedestal. She sits on her left leg, which is folded back. The right leg is drawn up so that her left elbow rests on the knee. Her chin rests on the top of her left hand. The right arm is slightly bent with this hand's fingers touching the pedestal. Wide circles consisting of pavers and grass surround the pool. \n\nI found this piece to be the epitome of simplicity and not especially appealing. I gave the work a quick look and noticed that it failed to hold the attention of myriad visitors passing by. This piece is a copy made by sculptor Ricard Hall and put here in 1982 to replace the 1909 original by sculptor Josep Clara i Ayats. That work now appears in the City Hall.\n\nLa Deessa is on the South side of Placa de Catalunya across from Hotel Olivia Plaza.", "publishedDate": "2018-05-21", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 453172497, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d11930450-r453172497-La_Deessa-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The big beautiful square, Plaza de Cataluna, has many sculptures.\nLa Deessa is one of them.\nLa Deessa (catalan) = La Diosa (espanol) = Goddess (english).\nThe first sculpture was made of Josep Clar\u00e9 in 1928.\nThe current copy was made of Richard Sala in 1982.\nLa Deessa is very beautiful young woman.\nShe is sitting on a little platform in the basin in the south corner of the Plaza.", "publishedDate": "2017-01-18", "language": "en", "rating": 3}]}}]
