This particular display (Exhibition #3) featured several of the artist's early surrealist drawings, a few bronze sculptures and paintings that spanned several decades (from the 1940s to present). The exhibit illustrated the evolution of Tapies' techniques and showcased his ability to create inspired works with varied materials. \n\nThe artwork here is breathtaking.
