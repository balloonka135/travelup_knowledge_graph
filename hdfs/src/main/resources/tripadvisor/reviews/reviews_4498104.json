It seems like a hodgepodge of art... and nothing too spectacular.  The best it has to offer are about 40 small bronze sculptures by one of Spain's most famous artist Salvador Dali, probably enjoyable to only Dali fans.  In my opinion it is not worth the high cost of admission.", "publishedDate": "2020-05-19", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 666047926, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4498104-r666047926-Royal_Artistic_Circle_of_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Interesting experience using total  virtual immersion to get a flavour of what climate change will mean.  However, the scenarios (like the flooded Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Espanya) still seem too much within the boundaries of BAU when in fact it could be far worse due to societal breakdown of norms worsened by climate-induced stress. Experiencing fascism / social violence / mass refugee / lack of food crisis -even virtually- would have been probably too controversial (and not enough \u2018entertaining\u2019) but probably more \u2018realistic\u2019! \n\nObviously, the \u2018hope\u2019 ending is nearly exclusively focused on the individuals and in an individualistic way. Nothing about the economic system and its values which are the drivers of climate change.  What about collective / social solutions to change the system ?  \n\nIn summary:  this \u2018entertaining\u2019 virtual experience will appeal to people who love the \u2018game\u2019 epoch in which we live in.

Still, if you want a sampling of Dali while actually in Barcelona there is a venue. There are 4 or 5 rooms and even hallways are used as display space. Its layout is such that you think each room is the last but then there is more. There are several hundred prints, dozens and dozens of photographs. ( more than I'd ever seen of Dali before) and few sculptural pieces I'd never seen before. The place lacks the imprint of Dali's design for the layout - the prints are displayed from ceiling to floor in almost every room - but indeed the place is a treat. The biggest problem with the place is finding it. I'd seen a banner on a pole mentioning a Dali Exhibition but no one at the hotel could find any info. Of all the hits on the internet only one way down the list finally gave an address. Eventually we found it on a small Calle leading of La Rambla on the opposite side near the Central Boqueria Market; even then there were no signs.
