This building was designed by Josep Maria Jujol, a contemporary of Anotni Gaudi and frequent collaborator on some of the latter best known works such as Casa Batll\u00f3, Casa Mil\u00e0 and Parc G\u00fcell.\n\nCasa Planells is ridiculously simple in comparison to the aforementioned monumental works. Practical as those were ethereal, Casa Planells is functional in it\u2019s designed as Antoni Gaudi was abstract. From the outside, the colours are subdued warm and inviting colours of browns and yellows and largely unadorned with motifs. The standout and probably most recognisable part of the building are the Art Nouveau influenced curved balconies at the corner of the building and protected by iron railings of latticework design.\n\nSimple, yet elegant building.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-13", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 563608301, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d12920026-r563608301-Casa_Planells-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The fantastic metropolis, Barcelona, has many beautiful and interesting buildings.\nCasa Planells is one of them.\nIt was built by the modernist architect Josep Maria Jujol in 1923-24.\nThe house is most well-known for the beautiful balconies on the corner.\nCasa Planells is situated on Avinguda Diagonal, close to Sagrada Familia", "publishedDate": "2018-03-01", "language": "en", "rating": 3}]}}]
