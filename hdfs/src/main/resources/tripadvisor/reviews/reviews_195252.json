The opening ceremony of the theatre took place on April 4th 1847. The building was devastated by a fire in 1861 and rebuilt under the direction of the architect Josep Oriol Mestres. Again the building was destroyed by a fire in 1994 and once more rebuilt, the relevant opening ceremony after finishing that last rebuilding works was held in 1999. The stated rebuilding conformed with the standards regarding the Opera House atmosphere and advantage of such a rebuilding was taken to enlarge the stage considerably in order to adapt the same to the present trends.\nThat Opera House stands in the Ramblas, which is perhaps the most popular, most crowded and most colourful street in Barcelona. In it the building concerned can be deemed as one of the most conspicuous architectural landmarks. It has three fa\u00e7ades and that looking onto the Ramblas is stupendous. At the entrance there are three portals with semicircular arches, there being above each one of them a large nicely decorated window of the same type. At the top level, above each one of the said windows there is a set of five smaller windows \u2013 three sets altogether \u2013 of identical style thus forming the whole a very attractive and beautiful ensemble. Everything inside the theatre is grandiose, beautiful and designed with a refined taste: the hall, the mirrors saloon, the staircase and of course the different interior spaces, architecture and decoration of the auditorium and stage. All the mentioned elements reflect the ambiance of the nineteenth century and therefore that monumental edifice ought to be deemed as a single artistic unit despite the different stages of building and rebuilding to which it has been subjected from 1844 to 1999. In this respect it must be outlined that the results corresponding to all the enlargements that the building has endured are not distinguishable from the original parts dating from the nineteenth century which were not affected by the different fires. Therefore the criterion of unity has been abidden by, what can be observed in the whole building from an architectural viewpoint. That feature keeps up with and is essential to the functionality of the Gran Teatro del Liceo.\nThe Opera House counts with a large artistic heritage. The most famous of its art works are the mural paintings consisting of twelve oil canvass works by Ramon Casas. Besides, the library and the art nouveau decoration at large are also outstanding elements in this regard, and the furniture, the sculptures and the inlaid work in the auditorium is a real sample of taste and splendid refinement.\nThe seats in general in the auditorium are very comfortable and their layout is very adequate for watching a performance easily. The acoustics inside the auditorium is fabulous. The singings and the music are easily audible from any part of it as clearly as if the singers and musicians were close to anyone of the audience irrelevant of the distance from the stage. The undersigned went there on April 6th 2017 to see the scenic interpretation of Rigoletto and it was great. Everything was perfect. \nThe only drawback as regards that Opera House is that the entrance fees are too dear, the more so if compared with those to be paid in similar opera houses in other European countries. The price of the pit seat tickets for the performance referred to in the previous paragraph was about 270 euros, which is simply abusive and ridiculously expensive. In spite of this disadvantage it\u2019s worth going to see an opera in that theatre though only once in the lifetime.", "publishedDate": "2017-05-25", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 481226038, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d195252-r481226038-Gran_Teatre_del_Liceu-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I was able to attend the express tour (30 minutes, \u20ac6) and it was excellent!

Regardless, the work they did is fabulous, and this is currently one of the top 5 opera houses in Europe.\nThere are many DVD recordings on sale from El Liceu, but BE AWARE, and this is very important, that most of the productions are very bold and contemporary, which many opera goers despise.\nI am not so against them, and actually, I have watched many which are done with gusto. I do admit that some others (Beito for instance comes to mind) are not very pleasant to watch. Ultimately, though, this is a personal preference and I am not trying to start a debate here.\nI'd say though that, if you love opera and happen to be in the city, get tickets and attend a show. Tickets are expensive and hard to find. Catalan people actually love music in general and opera in particular, so the venue is usually sold out. But still, try it and see it for yourself. The building inside is a pure joy, with many reasons for you to believe your money was worth.

We had reserved our seats several months ago and were pleased with our front row box seats. The house is a gorgeous 19th-century jewel, fully restored after the fire 20+ years ago. The production of Macbeth we attended was problematic. Dramatically the opera is inferior to Shakespeare's play, and the director, Christof Loy, did not help matters. By staging the work almost entirely in black and white he undermined its visual interest; the mostly bare stage did not help much either. On the other hand, Lucs Salsi and Tatiana Serjan, were excellent as Macbeth and his lady, as was Tedor Ilincai as Macduff. The chorus was simply wonderful. With a German director in charge, it was inevitable that the opera featured a number of unexplained bits of action -- what's with the man who gets stripped of all his clothes and strides slowly offstage dressed only in a piece of drapery? -- but we've seen far sillier things on German opera stages, or even in Toronto.

The building has had a refurb after the fire a few years ago, and I can't help but think that the designers aren't the ones who would opt for seating without a view. The toilets too are all beautifully laid out, but totally impractical.

I fought mightily against my heavy eyelids, but the opera was more than 3 hours long with intermission and I was being slowly defeated.
