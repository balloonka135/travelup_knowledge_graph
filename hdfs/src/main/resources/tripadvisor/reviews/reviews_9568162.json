It is dedicated to the abounded dogs (and other animals) and shows a starving, sad-eyed dog. On the base of the monument is a text of a nice poem written by Margarita Grollero Euras. I found an interesting information that similar monuments exist in many cities all around the world, from Mexico and Alaska to Moscow\u2026", "publishedDate": "2016-01-14", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
