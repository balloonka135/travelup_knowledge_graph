I could soon see why.  In the popular and trendy Gracia neighbourhood, Plaza del Sol is a buzzing vibrant place to spend time relaxing, catching up with folk, enjoying a drink, listen to music... There's an off-licence type of shop on one side where a bottle of cheap sangria or beer (they'll even provide you and your friends with cups at the checkout, just ask for them) so go pick up a bottle of something and go sit outside in the square for a couple of hours, enjoying authentic Barcelona :)", "publishedDate": "2015-11-06", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
