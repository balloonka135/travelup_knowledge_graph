Logging in on the Renfe site, I touch the logo showing a globe and it allows me to convert the site to English. It then ask for my personal details including that of my travelling companion and details of where I would like to go and date of travel. Upon completion, it showed me the train schedule for the chosen date with prices indicated. Once you make your choice, it will bring you to a payment site where you log in your payment details. My 2nd booking using the same credit card had a problem but when I used another credit card from a different bank, it was processed smoothly. Within minutes I received an email from Renfe confirming my bookings and asking me to print my tickets or keep them electronically. When I take the trains, it was a breeze. Just show your tickets at the gate and board the train. The inspector seems to have a manifest of all the assigned seats and will. Not bother you if it is  direct journey, otherwise you would merely be asked to show electronically or your printed tickets. Very efficient system and I do enjoy the ride.", "publishedDate": "2019-12-08", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 727848929, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d15208082-r727848929-RENFE-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "One fast way to visit a little piece of France is by taking the fast speed Renfe train at Sants Station in Barcelona and get to Perpignan, the first French town in the south of France.
