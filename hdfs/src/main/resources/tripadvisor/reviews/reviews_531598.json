It stands as an example of what really good restoration can do to widen understanding of Gaudi\u2018s work. Completely iconoclastic when compared with the standard Victorian family house of the late 19th C. it is astonishingly beautiful and full of colour and images of the natural world both inside and out.  Sadly the gardens which contained spectacular fountains, designed by Gaudi, gradually became diminished as pressure grew on land in the popular new area of Gracia. What space remains around the house, can hardly be called a garden but has at least been filled with plants to try and make good the loss. But for me the most exciting thing was the top floor which houses a collection of archival material. There are old photographs, models and copies of the original planning drawings for the house and its surrounding land. In all, a very worthwhile experience.", "publishedDate": "2020-04-12", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 751853507, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d531598-r751853507-Casa_Vicens-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Pleasent and calm experience.

I had high expectations for the interior of the property as I was living on the same street as Casa Vicens (carrer de les carolines) and so walked past it almost everyday for a year! However, when I finally got round to going inside I thought we paid a lot for the entrance ticket (\u20ac19 bought online, including a refreshment was the only offer). The interior is quite disappointing in comparison to the other Gaudi houses in my opinion and the majority of the house has been converted into a museum so has lost the original architecture. The best thing about Casa Vicens is the exterior without a doubt so I felt a bit cheated being made to pay so much to go inside.
