It shows up above most surrounding houses. Just standing in front of it makes you feel so tiny. All around are mass of people, taking pictures and enjoing the view.\nIf you bought your tickets online before you are able to enter the church in like 4 minutes. To get more information you can borrow a audio guide.\nThe first steps inside are so stunning. From outside it looks like overloaded but the inside is sober and calm. All people in it are silent and respectful. You can walk through the archways and hear your own steps. Looking up to the windows (mentioned below) introduces a wide spectrum of colours. If the sun is shining through the glasses you are able to see the whole basilica filled with coloured light.\nIf you have time and booked it before there is the opportunity to take the elevators and run up to some towers. Standing nearly on top of these towers you will get a beautiful sight over Barcelona looking from ocean to Parc G\u00fcell.\n\nIf you are planning to visit Barcelona, just take time for the Sagrada Familia. Please keep in mind that it will be clever to buy tickets before or you have to visit in not-seasonal months.\n\nI could just suggest everybody to stay a few days in Barcelona.

This was primarily because I didn\u2019t want to be tied down to a specific date and time, in case I ended up doing something different miles away from there during the booked time! The other reason is that tickets aren\u2019t available if you leave it too late, for example, even a week before you travel or visit Sagrada.\n\nThis is why I highly recommend purchasing a ticket in advance. *You will also avoid the long queues.* Luckily it wasn\u2019t too bad - it being in September. I mean I still had to wait for a good 45 minutes if not more. I\u2019ve heard the queues go round on the outside, stretching for God knows how long. Mine was bad enough. \n\nThe other benefit of booking in advance is that you can choose your time. If you\u2019re buying on the spot, and want to get in ASAP, the next entry may be an hour or two away, if not more, as it was in my case. So, as you\u2019ll have gathered by now, loads of time wasted by not buying online advance.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s also cheaper. I could\u2019ve bought the basic ticket (no audio guide) for \u20ac17 online, with the added advantage as stated above of instant entry, i.e. no queuing. Instead I had no option but to go for the only available ticket which was with the audio guide for twice the price - \u20ac34! All well worth it in the end though.\n\nHope this helped.

From 1914 until his death in 1926, he devoted all of his time to this project.  Because no government funds have been used, the church continues to be built very slowly\u2014relying on donations.  In 2005 UNESCO declared it a \u201cWorld Heritage Site,\u201d and in 2010 Pope Benedict XVI consecrated it as a minor basilica. Apparently, Gaudi originally neglected to get a building permit, so now the church has acquired millions of dollars in fines, in addition to the continued building costs.  The entrance fees from 3,000,000 visitors each year + donations keep the project going.  Although the fa\u00e7ade did seem like it had developed more since our last visit (over 20 years ago), we agreed that it still looks like a big mess, with cranes sticking out everywhere.  The \u201cglory fa\u00e7ade\u201d (front section) does have the colorful mosaic tops and interesting tall spires characteristic of Gaudi, but the back really has no color\u2014all muddy brown\u2014and there are so many things going on that it is hard to focus.

I had half an hour to appreciate the beautiful interior before heading up the Nativity tower. As I went up at 9.30 there was no queue. Once out of the lift I took in the beautiful views before making my way down the steps. I did the steps because I thought since I\u2019m here I might as well but in all honesty if I could do it over I wouldn\u2019t. If your claustrophobic and have a bit of vertigo then I definitely don\u2019t recommend it - never the less, it all added to the experience however it was a relief when I finally got to the bottom! Please note that you are asked to put your bag in a locker before going up in the lift so try to have a \u20ac1 coin on you for this.  It might also help to remember to take your water out of your bag to bring it up with you / I forgot and really could have done with a couple of sips on the way down.\nMake sure that if you have booked a time slot to enter the church in the morning that you stay until afternoon!  My time slot was 9am however I was still there at 12pm and I\u2019m so glad because if I\u2019d of left earlier I would have missed the stunning colours that come through the stained glass windows - it\u2019s magnificent and a must see!  I\u2019m still glad I booked the early slot to avoid the crowds but if you\u2019re short on time and can only do either morning or afternoon then it\u2019s a no brainier, afternoon is a must to see the church lit up in all it\u2019s beauty:-)\nAs I wanted to explore at my own leisure I chose I was happy to have the audio guide included in my ticket. It was very informative however I found that I was so overwhelmed by the different aspects of the church that I would must what was being said and found myself having to replay a let of the parts twice. If you\u2019re not pushed for time, I would recommend exploring the church twice. First without switching the audio guide on so you can digest everything at your own free will and then second time round with the audio guide playing.  I saw a lot of people holding the guide to their ear to listen so I\u2019m not sure if anyone realises that if you have a pair of headphones or earphones on you that you listen to your phone with you can plug those in, hang the guide around your neck and bobs your uncle your hands free!\nI would definitely recommend carrying a lot of snacks from you, maybe even bringing a packed lunch? I was there for many hours and found it came in handy and there are benches along the side of the church where you can sit if you need a break.\nAt the end of the tour there is a museum which I would say allow yourself about an hour to an hour and a half to explore. It is very very informative so do not miss this - on one hand I almost feel like it should be done first before viewing the church in order to really appreciate it and gain the background thats needed to really appreciate it.\nIt\u2019s a truly beautiful place.
