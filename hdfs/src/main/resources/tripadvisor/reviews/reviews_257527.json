The building is a huge Italian classicist style palace whose construction was completed in 1929 under the architects Eugenio Cendoya and Enric Cat\u00e0's design. The area of the Palace is nearly 50.000 square meters and its fa\u00e7ade is quite impressive, particularly if looked at from some distance. It's therefore advisable to watch it from the nearby Plaza de Espa\u00f1a and then all the way towards the building itself while walking along the Reina Maria Cristina Avenue. In the very center of the building above the main entrance there is a large dome which reminds that of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. On each side end there is a smaller one in the same style and between these and the mentioned larger one there are four towers calling up those of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.\nThe art works exhibited in that Museum are of a great value. They are grouped in different collections appertaining basically to romanesque, gothic, renaissance and baroque styles respectively, arranged in divers sets of rooms in different sections of the Museum. The great number of art works displayed makes a bit hard the contemplation in one single day of all of them in a way aligned with the high artistic qualities thereof. It's thus advisable not to push oneself to that point. On my visit to that Museum in October 2019 I personally had time only to watch the artworks contained in the sections dedicated to romanesque and gothic styles and decided to visit the rest of the Museum on a future occasion.\nAs far as the romanesque art works are concerned, One is quite impressed, for example, at the sight of the frescoes particularly from small  rural churches in some valleys situated in the Pyreneees Mountains or nearby. In this regard, a scene concerning a feast with minstrels and jugglers is outstanding. It's quite surprising to find such a kind of pictorial representations in a religious context but it may perhaps refer to the celebrations linked to the temple consecration. Likewise, the Pantocrator or Almighty (Christ in Majesty) executed in the twelfh century, which used to be in the apse of a church called St. Climent de Ta\u00fcll is a real masterpiece. There is also a large series dedicated to saints to which belongs the \u201cStoning of St. Stephen\u201d. There it's possible to see also some altar stones like that beautiful one originated from the church of St. Marcel de Plan\u00e8s, behind which there is a nice little figure of Christ as he was on the cross (Crist d'Escal\u00f3) hanging on the wall. Both items date back to the second half of the twelfth century and it's worth watching them attentively. Another jewel in that section are the frescoes of the apse of the ancient monastery of St. Pere de Burgal.\nIn general, the visit to the section concerned is of the essence to learn about the Catalan romanesque style. In this sense one may realise that some religious works in that style contain bizantine elements, as those existing in the altar front part of Avi\u00e0, which is a fabulous masterpiece most of whose traits show clearly the systematic use of a technique concerning the East Mediterranean art, such as the vividness and variety of colours and the pastillage d\u00e9cor on the background. Moreover, the majestic Virgin in the center of the retable is based upon the Greek type \u201cVirgin Hodegetri\u00e0\u201d (the one who shows the way). It's a great work before which one feels an indescribable sentiment. Likewise, the Oriental influence is evident in the magnificent front part of Baltraga, beautifully portraying the figure of Christ in the middle and depicting the martyrdom of St. Andrew, to whom the Baltraga church was dedicated, in one of its corners. That work is attributed to a Greek painter who signed one of his works as Master Alexander. Outstanding are also the paintings which decorated the chapterhouse of Sigena \u2013 an Aragonese nunnery which was unfortunately damaged by fire in the Spanish Civil War (1936 \u2013 1939) \u2013 . That decoration is really imposing. Some relationship has been found between it and the mosaics made by Byzantine artists in the Palatine Chapel in Palermo and the Monrealy Cathedral (Sicily).\nIt ought to be pointed out as well that in the romanesque section concerned one can also see some samples of Copt fabrics originating from Egypt in the fifth century, such as some taffeta ligaments. It's very interesting to watch them carefully taking their great value into account.\nThe gothic artworks which can be admired in that Museum form also a gorgeous art collection appertaining to the period comprised between the end of the twelfth century and the fifteenth century. At that time Catalonia territorial power within the context of the Mediterranean Europe was at its utmost. Among the works contained in that section masterpieces by painters like Jaume Huguet, Llu\u00eds Dalmau, Bernat Martorell and Llu\u00eds Borrass\u00e0 are outstanding.\nAs part of the gothic paintings, one can behold some superb murals about the conquest of Mallorca by Jaume I the Conqueror. They are dazzling and constitute one of the most relevant examples of the early Catalan gothic painting.\nAn important feature to be taken into consideration is the inclusion in the Catalan gothic painting in the second quarter of the fourteenth century of the great development of the Tuscan pictorial art, especially of that existing in Florence and Siena. Within that context the fabulous altarpiece portraying the Virgin and St. Anthony made of polychrome and gilded stone presumably in the workshop of Ferrer Bassa and his son Arnau can be inserted. Another splendid panel, a segment of a large retable, depicts the Adoration of the Shepherds. In the middle of the scene the Newborn portrayed in a peculiar way lies in a wooden manger. That scene contains likewise the images of St. Joseph and the Virgin as well as a female figure behind the latter who is supposed to be that of a midwife. Another wonderful work in that gothic section is what is thought to have been the top of a retable showing the Calvary. Particularly striking in that masterpiece is the magnificent pelican on the tree that grows from the cross.\nIn addition to the romanesque and gothic art collections to which the above statements refer one can behold in that Museum some wonderful works appertaining to the renaissance and baroque periods including some pictures from the Quattrocento and by masters of the Cinquecento, like Tiziano, as well as Spanish Golden Age paintings and rococo items. Among other paragons the Museum houses some paintings by the most reputed Spanish masters such as Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and Francisco de Goya, and works by great Flemish painters like Rubens and Lucas Cranach, as well as others by representatives of Modernisme (modern art collections): Antonio Gaud\u00ed and Ram\u00f3n Casas, among others; and of the avant-garde movements like Picasso and Mir\u00f3. Within the Modernisme style, some splendid interior design sets from exceptional architectural masterpieces, to wit Casa Amatller, Casa Lle\u00f3 in Morera and Casa Batll\u00f3 are also there encompassed.\nTaking the foregoing into account, it's beyond any doubt that the visit to the National Art Museum of Catalonia is higly recommended while in Barcelona for any art lover who wishes to contemplate incredible masterpieces as those displayed there, ranging from the romanesque period to the mid twentieth century. Besides, it's an excellent way to learn about Catalan  history.", "publishedDate": "2020-05-28", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 752437397, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d257527-r752437397-Museu_Nacional_d_Art_de_Catalunya_MNAC-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "My visit to Barcelona included only a brief visit to MNAC, but it made a big impression.

There are only 4 permanent displays in the building - Romanesque, Medieval, Classical, and Modern which means that each exhibit has a great deal of space (I was in the Hermitage once and everything was so jammed together you saw nothing, really).\nIt was the Romanesque exhibit that blew me away.  I went in expecting dull exhibits with sections of mosaics and frescos.  Instead, the incredible spaciousness allows the museum to recreate entire Naves, Apses, and Grottos and place the art in the architecture the way it would have been seen 800 -900 years ago.  \n  The result is more than impressive, it is awe inspiring.  Well worth the trip up even if you don't see the other exibits.\nAudioguides in multiple languages are available and well worth the expense (do not tour Romanesque without it).\nSeniors over 65 are free admission and a discount on the audioguide.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-12", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 688481513, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d257527-r688481513-Museu_Nacional_d_Art_de_Catalunya_MNAC-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We went here in the evening.it was the best place we went to in Barcelona.couldn't recommend this place enough  ", "publishedDate": "2019-07-10", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 688296678, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d257527-r688296678-Museu_Nacional_d_Art_de_Catalunya_MNAC-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Starting from the way up to get there, a tiny park, escalators, the building itself, continuing the opportunity to climb to the roof for the most spectacular views of the city, walk around on the roof to enjoy various perspectives, and then, enjoy the wonderful exhibitions of paintings, art details, and antique furniture.

The collection is unique, and the interpretation contemporary. I loved the presentation of the Romanesque church art - they built arches and domes to display the frescoes and murals in the configuration for which they were intended. The lighting of the sculptures in these spaces was also beautifully done, and highlighted the characteristic, attenuated forms common for the period. The collection of paintings were presented thematically (rather than chronologically, or focusing on the biggest marquee names), which I found interesting and challenging. The collection is very strong in Catalan modernism, both painting and decorative arts, which is unique, and anyone who is not a specialist will likely see something new and fresh.

We were far from the only ones to walk up, read the hours sign, and slink off in disappointment. To be clear it was my fault for not checking more details about open hours but in a City with so much to see we saved it for the late afternoon to be nearby for the Magic Fountains later. Views were still great from up at the site and a small 'pop up' gift shop was open but if I had just researched a little more we could have went there first and then other sites like the Fort up on top later before the fountain started.", "publishedDate": "2019-04-01", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 662728642, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d257527-r662728642-Museu_Nacional_d_Art_de_Catalunya_MNAC-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Having visited the Prado in Madrid a week earlier, this collection compares well.
