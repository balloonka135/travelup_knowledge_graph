I can't pretend to know much about this art form, but I read that she was described as \"the greatest Spanish\u00a0Romani dancer of her generation\".\n\nGiven such high praise, this fountain is a sad reflection of her career. The fountain is fairly simple, with relief sculpture of figure during a dance routine featuring three dancers and two guitarists. Apart from her name cut into a nearby metal board, it's nondescript, not even something to describe her life and career.\n\nIt's okay, but don't go out of the way to see it.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-16", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 677027545, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d9997409-r677027545-Fuente_de_Carmen_Amaya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Barcelona has a plethora of fountains.
