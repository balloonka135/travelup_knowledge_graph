At 51 metres, the tower looks majestic, especially with the spiral staircase on the outside of the tower about 40 metres up.

It was initially planned to reach a height of  80m but construction  ceased at 51m. It was inaugurated in 1882.At that time it was the tallest building in Barcelona. Its purpose was to store and supply water to the city but due to poor quality the water was directed to industrial purposes. Refurbishment of the structured was completed between 2010/2012.

As it was only my partner and me, the tour guide, who by the way was so passionate about the history of this tower, even offered to do the tour for us in English. The tower is designed by famous architect of modernism Pere Falqu\u00e9s who also designed the benches you find around the street lamps of paseo de gracia. After making our way all up to the top of the tower we enjoyed an amazing night view all over the city and finished the tour back down having a nice chat with the tour guide while having a glass of cava.", "publishedDate": "2017-12-31", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 389869698, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7390331-r389869698-Torre_de_les_Aigues_del_Besos-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Stumbled across this, if that is possible for such a large object.

It now stands out as a contrast to the new, hyper-modern Diagonal Mar.\nThe tower was supposed to provide water for parts of Barcelona, but because of the closeness to the sea the salinity level became too high, and the tower was closed down in the 1890s. It was then used by an industrial company until the late 1900s. This part of Barcelona used to house hundreds of factories; for this reason Barcelona was called \"Spain's Manchester\".\nRestoration work finished this year (cost about 3.5 million euros), and there are now regular visits to the tower. It is over 60 metres high and has four levels. From the observation deck you have an excellent view of the northern part of Barcelona. In an extension to the tower there is now the historical archives of Poblenou. \nAs far as I know the visits (some in the evening) are mainly in Catal\u00e1n, and only on Sundays in Spanish. There might be a possibility of group visits with an English guide if you contact the administrators (see web site below).\nBy the way, the clock on the outside of the tower doesn't show the time, but the capacity of the water tank!\n\nFor further information, consult: www.torredelesaigues.cat", "publishedDate": "2014-07-12", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
