In Rick Steves it is almost a footnote! We spent nearly 3 hours touring this architectural gem! This is one of the most unique and well thought out public buildings of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The audio-tour is both audio and visual as your audio box is also a mini TV with fantastic early photos and construction photos. \n\nYou are really cheating yourself if you do not take this tour!", "publishedDate": "2018-05-30", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 573119869, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10535133-r573119869-Esglesia_de_l_hospital_de_la_Santa_Creu_i_Santa_Pau-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I cannot even conceive any country anywhere in the world building such a magnificent hospital for the common people.
