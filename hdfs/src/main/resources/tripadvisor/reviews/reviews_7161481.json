The palace is in the heart of the Gothic Quarters, and as the archdeacon\u2019s residence, it sits just to the side of the Barcelona Cathedral\u2019s main portal, its entry facing the cathedral. And if you prefer Roman history to Catholic medieval, the back wall of the palace uses the original Roman wall that forms the gateway into what had been imperial Barcelona, called Barcino by Romans. If you circle the exterior of the palace structure, you will see the Roman gateway. Entry into the palace is free, and although it is in the midst of possibly the busiest tourist square in Barcelona, the inner courtyard is amazingly peaceful. There is beautiful tile work all along the cloistered courtyard and at the center is a huge palm tree and sweet fountain. While the palace is likely not worth an independent visit, definitely check it out if you are in the Gothic Quarters. At the very least, walk by to see its famous turtle and swallows mailbox that is to the right of the entry. In 1895, the city\u2019s Lawyers\u2019 Association moved into the palace and commissioned architect Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner to design the letter box with five swallows to guarantee the freedom of justice and a turtle to represent bureaucratic procedures that delay the legal processes.", "publishedDate": "2016-06-07", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 316118474, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7161481-r316118474-Casa_de_l_Ardiaca-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Outside this building may well be the most attractive mailbox you've ever seen, adorned with swallows and a turtle--an earlier era's way of suggesting air mail and slow mail?
