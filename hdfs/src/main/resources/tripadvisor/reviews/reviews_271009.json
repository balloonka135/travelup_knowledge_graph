However, we set the Madrid's tour as our benchmark after visiting Real Madrid FC less than 12 months ago. Unfortunately, our visit to Barcelona FC did not match the experience we had at Real Madrid in every single way. Our 2 biggest disappointments were:\nStaff's attitude:\u00a0\nThe biggest disappointment was about its appalling customer\u00a0service. Staffs were generally unfriendly but one of the staffs who stationed in the photoshoot section (right after the entrance, see my pic) had told me to \"Shut Up and Listen!\" - after I simply asking her politely whether we could skip the photoshoot as we didn't want to take the picture. She even did an offensive hand gesture to me whilst she spoke. Although I reported her to the management straight after and they apologised afterwards, but it was still a very unpleasant experience as she had ruined our moods for the rest of our tour at the stadium. I couldn't imagine how many people she had\u00a0treated badly if they didn't want to take the\u00a0photoshoot.\nVirtual Experience:\u00a0\nAnyone who had experienced VR before would know VR is supposed to make you feel that you\u00a0interacted with the 3D worlds. We didn't have much expectation but were hoping it would make us feel like watching a game inside Camp Nou -\u00a0even if it's just for 10 sec. However, we were gutted that it was just showing a documentary of Barcelona FC's history. The visual was extremely poor, it was like watching an old VCR (i.e. like watching a 144p resolution on youtube). It wasn't 3D, it had no movement connected to the body and it was actually just playing a very old and a non-action based documentary video. The sound was poor and the speaker was quite distanced\u00a0to my ears. The\u00a0pictures were so blurry, although the staff did try to fix it for me but it still didn't work. I asked the people around me and they all had given up and taken off the headsets before it's finished. (They all said it's rubbish so I was pleased that I wasn't the only one feeling cheated!) It was definitely the worst VR experience ever! i.e. Why would anyone want\u00a0to watch an old documentary and a poor quality video whilst sitting inside Camp Nou!?\nThe Real Madrid tour was a million times better in every way! It's the worst holiday experience we had in Barcelona! Highly NOT recommended unless if you're a Bar\u00e7a fan!", "publishedDate": "2020-05-25", "language": "en", "rating": 1}, {"id": 752764618, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d271009-r752764618-Camp_Nou-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We had a great time touring Camp Nou even bought some of the grass from the previous year as a memory.

The Seats to which our Tickets took us all, could not have been better placed, taking us  directly to the Back of the Barcelona Goal just behind the many Ardent Supporters,who never stopped Chanting and Singing throughout,whilst waving their Flags and Banners. As I sat in my Seat I took a while to look around and take in the Grand View above my Head around the Stadium,to see the many Tiered Seats, and it was only then that I realised what a Great Seat and View we had of the Game. It may be one thing taking in a Tour of the Stadium,but for the Majority of our Party, to attend an Home Game of the Mighty Barcelona, in Seats as good as these was something else, and possibly one that will never be beaten.Oh and the Score.....A 1-0 Win to Barcelona ( with another one disallowed for Offside ).

A friendly passerby saw how we were staring at our phones in confusion and pointed us in the correct direction. We purchased our tickets at the front gate with absolutely no wait time. Out of the selection of tickets we chose to get the full experience and here is my feedback.\nYou are first directed into what they kept calling \"the Organization\". I suppose it was a room intended on explaing the benefits of the Club to the world community at large and where the proceeds go. There were audio/ VR devices to use that explained the presence of the club in each community. 5 out of the 7 were not working. When we told the employee, He told us to wait. When we did not see/hear  back within 10 minutes. We walked out of the building, deeming it useless and a waste of time. You then go on a tour and are given iPhones and earsets to hear the audio explanation of every item you encounter through a long hall which displayed trophies, old soccer cleats, and tons of pictures and other soccer paraphernalia. The audio was very entertaining and I highly recommend actually listening to it while going through the tour. The tour eventually leads you into the stadium benches. The stadium looked like any other stadium, in my opinion. You walk to a selection of levels and seats in the stadium including the balcony seats. The audio then leads you through the locker rooms and eventually onto the pitch. I must say, although you don't get to freely walk on the pitch, there was some sort of excitement of being on the actually playing ground and getting some pictures. I visited on a Thursday and it was around 3 in the afternoon and there were very other visitors with us. After visiting the pitch at leisure, you go back up all the stairs and are lead to what they call \"The experience\" which is when you wear a VR headset and watch a short film in VR of a compilation of short clips of the players walking around the grounds. I have to say, this was a very bad experience. The graphics were absolutely horrible. I did not feel like I was 'living the moment\" or that I was actually near the players. As a matter of fact, the graphics continuously glitched and there was nothing \"real\" about it. It doesn't even deserve the name Virtual Reality.  After your tour, like any tour, you are lead to the gift shop, which in this case, is a 3 story awesome building filled with Barca merchandise made by both Nike and Barca companies.

They take 4 pictures of you during the whole walk, one with the jersey, one with the fake trophy and some other, and then before you exit the stadium, they already printed all the pictures of you and they give you in a small booklet.

The tickets were discounted at \u20ac20 each (instead of \u20ac26) because, as indicated on the website, the visit to the stadium would be offered in a limited way compared to the  usual due to matches scheduled in the following days. Aware of this, despite the fact that the museum was of little interest to us and the reason for our visit was only the stadium, we consciously decided to buy the tickets (\u20ac 40 in all) with visiting hours scheduled at 15.00. Arrived at the stadium, the very kind gentleman at the entrance reminded us that the visit to the stadium would have only be an \u201coverview\" and reiterates this in order to clearly avoid problems. Aware of this, we thank him, and we approached the entrance. We quickly visited the museum and afterward went directly toward the entrance of the stadium where, surprisingly, a gentleman informed us that \u201cthe stadium is closed to visits from 3pm, if you have problems with that you should complain at the entrance\". Embittered, we went back to the entrance and talked to a lady who wanted to reiterate that we bought discounted tickets and that therefore it could have happened that the stadium would have been closed. We therefore informed the lady that the tickets were certainly discounted but the discount was already justified by a limited visit to the stadium and NOT an impossibility to see the stadium. We took the young lady perhaps to the point where she found herself admitting that \u201cwe have internal communication problem and we never know at what time the stadium doors close\". She therefore advised us to ask at the ticket sellers if we could have get a refund. At the cashier then we were invited  to write an email with our concerns. What answer we got? The Tickets cannot be refunded in full or in any other way. \n\nUnfortunately, what left us most speechless is not so much the fact that we gifted 40\u20ac to a club that is certainly not short of funds, but rather the lack of professionalism, inefficiency and incompetence on the part of one of the most important clubs in the world in simply managing transparent communication and visits to a museum! \nYour Real Madrid friends probably know it better!", "publishedDate": "2020-02-24", "language": "en", "rating": 1}, {"id": 747383596, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d271009-r747383596-Camp_Nou-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "What an amazing experience.

We enjoyed the virtual reality experience which gives you a sense of what it would be like on a match day. Definitely op for this even though it's only short. You get to go higher on your tour. My husband doesn't like heights so we diverted this section. Then my son loved having a virtual photo with Messi! At the end of the tour you are given a chance t buy a selection of photos. They are not pushy. We ended up buying the full set as a birthday treat! However you can also go out without buying. Staff were lovely and patient when viewing photos. We visited the shop and bought a cap. My son would have loved a shirt but 170 euros was way too much!!! \nMy son has spoken about this visit a lot and it will remain his best experience if Barcelona! It might not be the cheapest of visits but a once in a lifetime experience!
