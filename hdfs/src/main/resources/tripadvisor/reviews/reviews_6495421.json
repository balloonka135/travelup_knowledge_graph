With the T10 card, the funicular transfer was free. I presented my confirmation email at the ticket office and got our tickets to use for our cable car trips. When we arrived shortly after opening, there was no queue so we hopped on the first available cable car. It was a large car and we were lucky to have it all to ourself.

We thought this was the cable car that went from Montju\u00efc to Barceloneta. But that cable car is called Port Vell Aerial Tramway, which crosses Port Vell, Barcelona's old harbour, and connects the Montju\u00efc hill with the seaside suburb of Barceloneta (don\u2019t get the two confused).  The Montju\u00efc cable car runs from the upper station of the Montju\u00efc funicular, and climbs up the Montju\u00efc hill to a terminal near the Montju\u00efc Castle. It affords great views of the Barcelona skyline. We recommend buying the round trip ticket, unless you plan to walk down or take other transportation from the hilltop. The day we went, there was no long lines or wait to get on the cable cars.", "publishedDate": "2019-06-05", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 679146040, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d6495421-r679146040-Teleferic_de_Montjuic-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Great views as you climb to the Montjuic castle.

When paying I asked how much, the lady serving wasn't very attentive and was chatting to a colleague, she just said 8 Euros 40 each, I paid and got on, looked at the ticket at it said \"one way\" so we got off about 4 to 5 mins later at the bottom of the hill to then have to walk up again to visit the castle...not the best move lol. For the short time it took, there were quite scenic views of Barcelona city but overall I found it a bit average especially at the price, I believe a return trip would've been 12 Euros each, I think a single gives you enough of the experience but probably getting it from the bottom to the top ! Castell de Montjuic at the top is inexpensive at 5 Euros for above 30 yrs old and 3 Euros for under although this too is pretty average with not a lot to see but great views of the port on one side and Barcelona city on the other.", "publishedDate": "2019-04-20", "language": "en", "rating": 3}]}}]
