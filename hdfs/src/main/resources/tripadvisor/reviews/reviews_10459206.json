Compared to the list price to get into the museums, you might save a little, or if you go to all 6 it might work out to your advantage.  If you take the Hop On Hop Off Bus, you get a discount booklet that gets you 20% off most, if not all, of the museums on the Articket.  That negates the Articket savings.  It might help at the Picasso Museum, if there is a line for tickets.  There was not when I went. The other places had no lines.

Some have audio guides, usually worth taking unless you are already familiar with the artist or work on exhibit. Picasso and Miro are single artist exhibits. The Art of Catalunya is a history of Catalan artists and for those going to any of the Gaudi sites would be useful for understanding context and seeing works by his contemporaries like Jujol, for example, who did work at Park Guell. The Contemporary galleries may not be focusing on Spanish art at all but worth the visit as they will be exhibiting significant work in any event. At the CCCB for example, we saw a show called Making Africa and at MACBA we saw the Andrea Fraser exhibit. \n\nIf you are at all interested in art Catalonia has some of the greatest in its list of names and this is the way to experience them.", "publishedDate": "2016-06-29", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
