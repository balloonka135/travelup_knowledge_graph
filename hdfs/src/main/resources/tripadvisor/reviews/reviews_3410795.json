Recently it has undergone a huge regeneration programme which was apparent when, taking a right turn off the Plaza Catalunya end of Las Ramblas, I came to the very impressive Museum of Modern Art. This is surrounded by old buildings which have been turned into places of culture and university halls.This part of the Raval district is dotted with lovely old shady squares and interesting shops such as La Chinata the Aladdin's cave of olive oil. Further South the area became a bit rougher, the shops and restaurants less trendy and there were groups of prostitutes, left over from Raval\u2019s former existence, sitting out on the pavement. I came to the newly created Ramblas del Raval dominated by a huge statue of a rather creepy cat and the new Hotel Barcelo which is shaped like a round tower. Following my guide book\u2019s instructions I went through the elegant lounge to the lift and up to the 11th floor. There I found a terrace that ran right round the top of the tower which gave a wonderful 360\u00b0 view over Barcelona. Unfortunately there was quite a wide health & safety barrier all round the outside wall but at least there was no glass between you and the view which was spectacular. I continued South and came to the Hotel Espa\u00f1a. Although it dates back to the 1850\u2019s, it was refurbished in Modernist style in the early 20th century and was very fashionable. It was a place to see and be seen in its day. It fell on hard times when El Raval was going downhill but has been beautifully restored. I looked around the wonderful decor in the public rooms, staircase and La Fonda Restaurant. I even went on the roof where there was a terrace bar. I was knocked out by the dramatic furnishing.

The reviews of the area are accurate--it is a very diverse and very eclectic district and worth exploring.  If you are from a large/diverse urban area, you will feel very comfortable in the district; however, I do understand many of the comments from visitors who felt less comfortable during their visit to the area.  I enjoyed the diversity and eclectic nature of the neighborhood and loved that you could find restaurants with kabobs and tapas on the same menu.  The restaurants in the area are also very diverse, but the food was good and much less expensive than in other parts of the city.  Also a great location for authentic Indian and Pakistani food and coffee.  The Museum of Contemporary Art is very good and after your visit you can watch the skateboarders in the square.  \n\nI stayed in two different apartments in El Raval.  Both were comfortable and well equipped; however, the noise during the night is non-stop and very disruptive for a light sleeper.  I stayed on Carrer de la Riereta and Carrer de les Carretes during my stay and had an equally difficult time sleeping in each apartment.

Visit it I did nonetheless, and as usual the truth was very different to the reports and perceptions. Myself and my partner did not have any problems in the area, which naturally colours my review and I appreciate those who had a problem will feel very differently, but it simply was not that bad an area. \nWe went there to drink absinthe at the famous Bar Marsella which is on the corner of 2 of the most infamous streets, Carrer de Sant Ramon (prostitutes) and Calle de Sant Pau (junkies). We were there at around 1am and the truth is Sant Ramon was completely clear of anyone and very well lit, and Sant Pau had a few prostitutes hanging around but they just hang around in the shadows and don't bother anyone. The only other characters hanging around were Pakistani guys selling cans of beer, who ask if you want one and take no for an answer. The exact same people can be found in the Gothic Quarter.  Seedy, yes, but no obvious threat to personal safety. \nWe returned there 2 nights later to visit MACBA modern art gallery which had a late-night opening and the area was full of people, a great atmosphere. The numerous bars and restaurants were packed as late as 1am. Raval looked and felt exactly the same as other central areas. On returning to La Ramblas we noticed far more prostitutes hanging around and would have felt uneasy had it not been so busy. \nRaval has fantastic bars and restaurants and is well-lit, central and busy. A big effort has apparently been made to clean up the area. There are alleyways you would not fancy walking down late at night but that applies to any district of any city. \nDon't miss this great area.", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 204031114, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d3410795-r204031114-Raval-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "1 star hotel looked like a brothel.
