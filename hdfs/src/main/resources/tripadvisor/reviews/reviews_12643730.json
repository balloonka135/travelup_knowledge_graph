Aside from being quite small, it's main purpose seems to be the display of a monument called \"Monument to the heroes of 1809\". \n\nThe monument depicts the five martyrs who were executed after an attempted insurrection against the occupying French troops during the Peninsular Wars. The five bronze pieces show the people condemned to the club just before their execution. On the pedestal are written the names of the martyrs. The sculpture is unusual in being sculpture is a realist style in contrast to the Gothic Cathedral of Barcelona opposite.\n\nFor those who can read Spanish, there are also tiles on either side of the monument that tells the story of the uprising and the martyrs.\n\nBeautiful monument.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-18", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
