So my visit this time to Barcelona included Bellesguard, among other Gaudi's earlier works.\nI went on a Friday morning (no guided tours on weekdays).  There was no one else but me visiting the place (there were only a few people coming at the end of my visit).  An audio guide was included in the ticket.  While you can wonder around freely in the garden, you can only enter the castle like building at a fixed time when a staff comes and opens the door. He will accompany you all the way (I think to ensure people do not run around at random, as the place is still in private hands, and do any damage to the building), and show you the places (including the roof) that you can enter.  He does not do the explanation (the audio guide does). You can see Gaudi had applied/experimented many of his ideas/techniques here (e.g. trencadi works, elaborate ironwork, a soaring Catalan cross).  The interior stairway was beautifully decorated with lovely tiles on the wall, and a beautiful lamp.  The brickworks on the top level are exquisite.  The roof can be accessed via narrow steps (having a group up there would definitely be very crowded) and the pathways on the roof are very narrow. There are good views of Barcelona from up there. Gaudi had designed the windows on the roof to make them look like the eyes of a dragon.  How ingenious!

The tour I took was with an audio guide which was perfect for my needs (as I sometimes like to sit down during a tour and press pause for a few minutes). To end my review I should say that it is not very easy to find because of its location unless you keep reading....Take the Metro Line 7 (I think) to Av Tibidabo (which is the end of the line). With your back to the exit of the station and your nose pointing to the big road in front of you, head off left along the big road. After about 5 minutes you need to turn right and head up a hill (you'll need to look up the road names on a map but a child of 5 could manage this). It took me about 12 minutes from the station but I had to stop for directions as you can't really see the building until you're at the entrance. Alternatively you could get a bus...at the exit of the station you need to cross the big road and head towards where the tram departs for Mount Tibidabo. The bus stop you need is (approx) the third one up (depending on whether you count the Tram stop as one!)

He was the King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona. He acquired the land in 1408 and built a castle which he called Bellesguard because it had beautiful views of Barcelona. It is located at the Sarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi district of Barcelona, and halfway up the Collserola mountain. \n\nIn 1893 the Bishop of Astorga Joan Baptista Grau died. He was an intimate friend of Gaudi and Gaudi had built for him the Archbishop\u2019s Palace in Astorga. The Bishop in his will asked that all his properties be sold and the profits put for charitable purposes. Gaudi learned of this and told his close friend Maria Sagues, who was the widow of Jaume Figueres (a flour merchant). She was a longtime admirer of Gaudi and she had wanted him to build a house for her. The property had an area of 12 hectares and contained the ruins of the former castle. In 1900 Maria Sagues bought the land, and asked Gaudi to build her house. The house was finished in 1917 and is also called Casa Figueres. She lived there until the Civil War. The house passed through other owners and was declared a National Monument in 1969.   \n\nGaudi designed a castle that looked like medieval castle of the 15th century. He used the Neogothic style to pay homage to the ancient king. The castle has very symmetrical windows and the shape of the castle is like a cube. The fa\u00e7ade is faced with local stones in tones of grey and green. On one side is a tower that is topped with the cross with four arms that is a signature design of Gaudi. Beside the entrance to the castle are two benches with mosaic designs, designed by Domenech Sugranyes. Inside the castle as one goes up the stairs, there is a beautiful stained glass window that shows a star. The attic is a very large room that has not been finished in the interior and it has windows on every side. One can see the exposed bricks that support the roof and the way Gaudi planned it. \n\nThe building was opened to the public in September, 2013. The entrance fees help with the maintenance costs.
