We spent a couple of hours here enjoying the calm, kids got to play a bit of football on the green spaces and there is also a kiosk selling ice cream, drinks, etc. Toilets can be found in the nearby bus station. A lovely way to spend some time if you are in the area.", "publishedDate": "2019-10-30", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 712661844, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10491414-r712661844-Parc_de_l_Estacio_del_Nord-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Small, cute park that is not so crowded with tourists, inside park you can see local people how hanging out in free time.", "publishedDate": "2019-09-24", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 591859272, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10491414-r591859272-Parc_de_l_Estacio_del_Nord-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I spent few hours in this parc!
