It runs from north to south, starting from Placa De Catalunya, through the heart of the old Barcelona (Barri Gotic and El Raval) and finishing at Monument of Columbus by the seafront. The total length is 0.75mile and the street is located between Catalunya, Liceu and Drassanes metro stations.\u00a0\nLa Rambla is a wide pedestrian street filled with various stalls selling cheap souvenirs, bouquets and the round the clock kiosks selling anything that you'd find from a corner shop. It also has many outdoor seating areas which their restaurants are located on both sides of the road. Passers-by shouldn't be surprised if they see restaurant staffs trying to pull them to sit down at one of their\u00a0tables. This street is also well-known for pickpockets so please be extra careful with your wallets when you got there.\u00a0\nLa Rambla is also a hub for entertainment, souvenirs and food and it's almost a \"Must-Visit\" place for tourists due to its prime location. Although I don't think this street has any special or has anything that you can't find anywhere elsewhere in Barcelona.\u00a0", "publishedDate": "2020-06-05", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 753397903, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d190163-r753397903-Las_Ramblas-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This marketplace is fantastic, so much food to choose from.

The boulevard runs north and south and cars have a one lane road each way.  Las Ramblas runs  from Christopher Columbus Memorial in the south to Placa de \n Catalunya in the north.  If you are staying in the northern area you will have easy access to the Aerobus Express which can take you to the airport. It is also where the Barcelona Tour Buss departs from. If you need camera batteries, an adapter or stationary, El Ingles, a department store is located in the north end.  The southern end has the Port Veil, the cruise ship terminal. The Liceu theater is roughly the  half way point from north to south.\n\nIf you are looking south to the Christopher Columbus Memorial on left is the Gothic Quarter and the right the Ravalazal area.  The Gothic Quarter should not be visited  at night.\n\nLas Ramblas features hotels, shops and restaurants which command premium prices. I stayed in one one the hotels right on Las Rambas. The Spanish people like to party late in the evening and the street is noisy  until 3 am in the morning.  Notable are the many  late night clubs, street performers and La Boqueria market.

We shopped around and could not really find a suitable place to eat where we felt comfortable with hygiene and then when shopping the attitude to us was rather concerning as many of the tourist places and shops were no very friendly and we were even told that many of the people in Barcelona no longer wanted the tourists from ships as it made their lives difficult and they then went on to say they would prefer more refugees rather than tourists. I can honestly say that the stay there then made more sense and my wife did not feel very safe there with the refugees drunk and fighting all hours of the night in the streets.

And that is why it gets 4 stars. It\u2019s a good channel to get to a lot of other places to see in Barcelona that are NOT Las Ramblas. \n\nI have no real experience with the businesses on this street itself. Before going on the trip I read or heard from pretty much every source I used that Las Ramblas is to be avoided. Walk it, fine. But the restaurants are overpriced, the food items are poor reflections of the city cuisine, and the shops are just there to gouge tourists from as much extra money as possible. Which is true of any tourist shop but I got the impression you\u2019d be charged more here for the same thing you could buy a block away. I didn\u2019t test this theory, as I heeded the advice and never shopped or ate anywhere on Las Ramblas. \n\nThe pick pockets are another thing. Look, people talk about this happening in Barcelona like these pickpockets are almost supernatural or something. It isn\u2019t like that. You just have to pay attention to your surroundings. There is no reason to shop or eat here. Even if the side-street businesses are just as touristy/money holes, they are less populated and easier to catch on if someone is marking you. So don\u2019t stop on Las Ramblas. Use it to get somewhere else. Keep moving. Get it behind you. \n\nI never had an issue because I never stopped moving here and I have very good situational awareness. When some guy tries to get your attention and get you to slow down or stop to talk to him (happened to me a few times here)  he is most likely trying to distract you so his buddy you don\u2019t see can pick your pocket. DONT STOP.    Don\u2019t slow down for him.  Say no thank you as you keep on your way. Keep your distance from everyone and don\u2019t let people brush you. Frequently check tour pockets. Keep your hands on or near them to keep other hands out. \n\nThis might sound like too much but really all you have to do is be a little vigilant. If you start to get drawn in and forget where you are, youre more at risk. But pay attention and you should be okay. There are pickpockets but it isn\u2019t like an epidemic. Stay alert but dont be afraid.  \n\nAnyway, this brings me to why this street is good. It\u2019s long and wide and it is sort of central to A LOT of the popular stuff to see in Barcelona. There are cathedrals, good restaurants, the gothic quarter, the erotic museum, Palau Guell, etc. I\u2019m talking fairly short walking distance. We stayed just off Las Ramblas and it got a little loud at night on occasion (guy puking his guts out for example) but not bad. Definitely worth it for the location.
