Each of the 5 \"museums\" are interesting but they're all very small. If you don't stop to take any photos you could walk through each in 5 minutes or less. Basically the whole museum is set up for you to take interesting photos, so if you want cool photos, go for it, but if photos aren't your thing you should pass. Keep reading for info on each \"museum\". \nThere are five \"museums\":\nGiant's house: includes a collection of extremely oversized everyday objects that you can take photos next to in order to give the illusion that you are in a giant's house playing with their things. There are about 20-25 items to pose with.\n\nSweets: includes large statues of assortments of candies and other sweets as well as a lot of pink and purple animals to pose with. Same here, about 20 different photo opportunities.\n\nTopsy Turvy: This one is really cool and if you opt to get a ticket for one \"museum\" only I suggest this one. This one has a bunch of different rooms staged upside down. if you take a picture of yourself and include both the ceiling and floor in your picture it will look like you're dangling from the ceiling. This one was really crowded though when we went so you should practice patience while trying to take the perfect photo.\n\nBelieve it Or Not: First, I don't recommend this for really small children. My daughter is 2 and she screamed and cried through most of it. There are some scary things in there, especially the 3rd room which includes an exhibit that has several demos of ancient torture methods...the other rooms have some creepy wax figures in them too that may scare small children as well.\n\nDry Pool: Basically a giant ball pit. Don't let the photos fool you, there are no cool props to play with or take cool photos on. It's literally a giant ball pit that adults and children horse around in. If you only purchase a ticket for 1 \"museum\", I don't suggest you use it on this one.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-16", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 678389126, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7914040-r678389126-Museum_of_Illusions-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Decided to kill some time so wanted something fun to do.
