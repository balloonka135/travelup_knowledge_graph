It used to be a part of a monastery which was founded by canons appertaining to the religious order of the Saint Sepulchre of Jerusalem. In the church a mixture of romanesque and gothic styles can be observed. As a matter of fact, the construction of the temple started in the Xii century but in the following centuries the nave and the vault were enlarged introducing gothic pointed arches.\nThe church exterior is quite sober, being the belfry tower the most conspicuous element thereof. It's much taller than the main building and its appearance is that of a narrow architectural complement with an artistic spike. The belfry contains three bells, two of them under the spike and the third one above the other two and equidistant from each one of them. The bell strokes are very pleasant to hear. By the building in question there is a yard within the enclosure which is usually very calm and peaceful. It's a delight to sit on a bench in that yard for a while and enjoy the peacefulness of the lieu.\nThe Curch is a very simple but nice single-nave one with a rectangular apse in which the Cistercian influence is outstanding. The nave is sober but elegant. At the entrance there is a chapel dating back to the twelve century which is dedicated to the Immaculte Conception. In that chapel there is a splendid gothic reredos depicting St. John the Evangelist. The paintings housed in the Church about some events regarding S. Josep Oriol's life were made by the painter Josep Llimona. They are also worth being watched. At the end of the transept there is the St. Sepulchre chapel containing a sculptural group representing the burial of Christ. Although it's a replica of the original work which is in the Barcelona Diocesan  Museum, it's an attractive sculpture full of beauty.\nThe cloister was built in the fifteenth century. It has a square shape and on each side  there are ten arches. In some of the corbels the renaissance influence is apparent.\nThe visit to that church is recommendable.Before of after admiring the marvels which the Church harbours remaining some minutes in the yard can confort the solul owing to the calmness and beauty of the site.", "publishedDate": "2018-09-30", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 619831962, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2272433-r619831962-Santa_Anna_Church-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Wished I had more time to explore this but time was against me.

But the cloister and roof are Gothic. The cloister actually shows the evolution of style from Catalan Gothic to Renaissance. Different styles relate to the church's beginning as a monastery for centuries and then a 3-century building project for its transformation to a church. Striking Romanesque features include windows that display scenes from the Book of Genesis. The central nave shows off Catalan Gothic style.\n\nSanta Anna Church is quite close to Placa Catalunya.
