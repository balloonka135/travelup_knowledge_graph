Water inside the park is expensive to buy, so bring your own. The zoo has many water fountains where you can refill the bottles. No diarrhea episodes so safe to drink.  The children's park was an added bonus with loads of rides and slides designed with little adventurous explorers in mind. The park also has a shaded area where there is a water mist so you can cool down as well. The zoo is conveniently located near metro stops. Best to visit in the morning when it opens to catch the animals outside and active. After the zoo you can walk to the Santa Del Mar cathedral which is a 10-15 min walk. In the afternoon, the big felines retreat into shade. The monkey exhibits, the Macaw exhibits are really good. The place for the animals seems cramped but I have been to many zoos and most are cramped for animals. Anything less than their natural surrounding is cramped.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-17", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 688544523, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244821-r688544523-Barcelona_Zoo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I had high hopes when visiting this zoo I was really looking forward to it. On entering the zoo I was given a map and as we were walking through I saw signs for a dolphinarium. I was shocked as I hadn\u2019t seen any information prior about dolphins being kept here and I am not the biggest fan of them being in captivity. I thought I would look there later as I wanted to see other things first. Going round the zoo it was apparent these animals were being well cared for, their enclosures were quite big and they seemed to be content. When going to the dolphinarium it was apparent this may not be the case. We queued up to go and see what I thought was a show however it was a dingy, rusty pool (photo below) in which  just a few hours in the day where these dolphins were allowed out of their small holding pen into a slightly bigger holding pen to float around aimlessly. I had to leave soon after as it was quite upsetting seeing the dolphins in this way considering how they are in the wild. I was very confused as to why there was no information about them on the website, the map or anywhere else so I googled \u201cBarcelona zoo dolphins\u201d and to my horror I found that the zoo had been banned from hosting dolphin shows as they were mistreating them. The dolphins as I understand are now in the process of being sold of and therefore are just held in a pen for most of the day then let out for a couple of hours for the public to see. This really ruined what was a great day as like I said every other animal in the zoo had bigger enclosures and an overall better quality of care than these poor dolphins.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-10", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 688448757, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244821-r688448757-Barcelona_Zoo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "It was ok but nothing special... it worked...
