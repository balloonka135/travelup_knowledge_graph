This is done in a tasteful, well organised way and at no point is it intrusive. \n\nSeeing the bodies of real people is a slightly strange feeling and it is important to establish whether in fact these bodies were given legally to science. \n\nThe headphone explanation is well-done and accompanies you through the rooms, so much so that you are alone with yourself in many ways. It could be improved by have a 'fast' way through with a shorter explanation for those of us with little knowledge of anatomy. The exposition is in all languages including the language of Catalunya and its capital Barcelona, Catalan, which is a point in its favour and not always the case. \n\nThe write to right, yes but also the write to right in Catalan brings me to my final point: Tripadvisor censored my first opinion and sent it back because it was in Catalan. It will not allow me to use Catalan when speaking about  this fascinating exposition. I hope Tripadvisor will realise the value of allowing travellers to use their own mother tongue, especially if one takes into account that hundreds of the hotels, restaurants and attractions adhered to the website are located in Barcelona and deserve to be commentated in Catalan, if the traveller so wishes.
