The impressive for visitors is the bedroom of Gaudi, in which there is a wardrobe and his bed. It is strange that the bed is very narrow, as should be necessary. While he had the money to have a bigger and comfortable bed, he imposed on itself restrictions with rigor. As a deeply religious Catholic, drew motivation from the perfection of the Divine!\nMy personal view of his works is that he managed to find the symmetry and harmony, characteristics which established his works as Monuments, which are close to the \u2018\u2019Divine Perfection\u2019\u2019!
