The Magic Fountain is a 'must-see' Barcelona attraction. You have never seen a fountain like this. It does feel magic to experience the beautiful show of water, light, and music. built-in 1929 as one of the main attractions for the 1929 Barcelona World Fair and the Font Magica is still one of the most famous places in Barcelona with millions of visitors annually.\n\nI would suggest reaching here early, it starts at 9 PM but stairs (where public sit) gets crowded easily. Don\u2019t worry if you reach early, there is enough street show that happens and there is a big castle so there is ample to do here. \n\nIn the winter the fountain only has evening water and light shows on Friday and Saturdays. In the summer the evening light and music show are from Thursday to Sunday. And it's FREE...!!", "publishedDate": "2019-10-25", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 721235496, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d501696-r721235496-The_Magic_Fountain-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Practically one of those things that makes you realize how great people are when they want to do great things.

But it was still quite a sight.  Towering over everything and everyone around it and constantly changing in its patterns.  It was quite enjoyable just to sit in the surrounding park while relaxing and enjoying its roaring jets of water.  \n\nAt the same time as our visit to the fountain, there was a crew filming a BBC series (at least that was what the army of production assistants told us).  Everytime they were ready to say action, all of the regular tourist had to be herded out of sight so the fake, back ground tourists could commence acting.  There were three young girls pretending to take selfies, a young woman who would push a stroller through and a man who would quickly pass through the frame on a bike.  All the while the primary actors would have volatile disagreement ending with the younger man storming off.  I really did feel bad for the PA's trying to preserve the sanctity of the shot by keeping passers by from walking through.  Most people who encountered the PA's miming a old timey camera filming would be agreeable and alter their path.  But there were several who just completely blew through the warnings and stormed through the set.  The PA's helplessly trailing them, trying to convince them to alter their course.\n\nUnfortunately I can't promise you a similar experience.  I don't think they film scenes for a BBC series at the fountain every day.", "publishedDate": "2019-10-19", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 719569831, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d501696-r719569831-The_Magic_Fountain-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This is a fantastic free show. 45 mins of music to fountain show.
