We particularly enjoyed our guided tour of Hospital Sant Pau. This complex, which was built between 1901 and 1930, appeared to be more of a charming, welcoming village than a hospital complex. I learned that this hospital, which was still in operation up until 2009, was purposely constructed to be a welcoming and warm place for patients. The buildings have lots of glass which bring in light from sunshine and the interiors appear to be built for comfort as well as maximizing excellent patient care. From the Administration Building to the Operating Building as well as the other buildings are still well maintained and are now a museum. In addition, one of the large rooms within the complex is now utilized for musical performances. I can only imagine how special those performances must be.\n\nIf only more hospitals around the world would be able to provide the high level of care provided by this hospital including a location on such a magnificent campus.", "publishedDate": "2020-04-11", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 752020675, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1192272-r752020675-Recinte_Modernista_de_Sant_Pau-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I read that this is a more recent attraction that sits high on the list of MUST DOs when visiting Barcelona.

Sant Pau continues as a work in progress and is in the grounds of a fully functioning hospital, some areas of which are still in these amazing old buildings.\nGiven what I'd read about it, we decided not to buy tickets in advance and that proved to be a good decision.

The architect believed in the natural healing power of beauty and nature and wanted to create a place where the poor could recuperate and heal while in the midst of nature, beauty, and light.  He designed pavilions that were dedicated to specific medical purposes e.g. maternity, non-contagious diseases, etc., and they were all connected by underground tunnels.

The interiors of the wards, one of which has been recreated, were quite functional - following similar planning guidelines to hospitals here at the time, but one of the tricks was that there was a series of wide tunnels underneath for beds, trolleys etc, so the buildings are separated and the grounds are well-landscaped, for patients to enjoy.  The best artists of the time were employed for the decoration of the buildings and of the interiors of the main administrative building, which are beautiful examples of architecture and art at the time. .  \n\nThe hospital was in use until 2009, and has been replaced with a new modern one a short distance away which has a new research building and the first Maggie's Cancer Centre outside of the UK.  The site has been opened since 2014 as a museum and cultural centre, after extensive renovation with some of the buildings rented out to related organisations, including Barcelona University and one of the 'waiting-to-be-restored' wards is also open to see.

They've since built a new hospital nearby and converted this amazing space and opened it to the general public.  The complex consists of eight pavilions connected by beautiful walkways and landscape to a degree.

However, the ones that are open to the public are very interesting to spend time in.
