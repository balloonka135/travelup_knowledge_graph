Remembered the quality of the clothes from a previous visit years ago. Was impressed by the staff, their willingness to help someone with limited Spanish, and the quality, yet decent value of the clothes. Would recommend this store to others seeking high quality clothes from a Spanish-based company.", "publishedDate": "2019-08-07", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
