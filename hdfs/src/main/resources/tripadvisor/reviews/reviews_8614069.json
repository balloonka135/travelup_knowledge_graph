You can't miss it if you are passing that way. We were surprised to come across such a strange artwork, but we found it very likeable, funny, unusual and quite lovely. It seems to be a sort of seductive heroine waiting for her hero, who could, in all likelihood be the Bull, the sculpture sitting right across the other end of the road, at some distance, of course. But the Bull, quite obviously, has not made his move, yet!!! This is definitely a must see, at least if you are in the vicinity.", "publishedDate": "2019-05-24", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 672159289, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8614069-r672159289-Flirty_Giraffe-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The defenders of the Rambla used art to prevent it from becoming a boulevard, which would have broken the initial design with a central causeway and two rows of trees.\n\nIn 1972, a well-known sculptor and engraver Josep Granyer made two animal sculptures, one giraffe to be placed at the Diagonal intersection and one bull at the Gran Via intersection. \n\nSo the Rambla between Diagonal and Gran Via was changed to an art park and the road project was stopped.", "publishedDate": "2019-05-07", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 587576395, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8614069-r587576395-Flirty_Giraffe-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Loved this item, right in place of the area of modern art in a classic district.
