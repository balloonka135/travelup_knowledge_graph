It is nice to see it when on the Ramblas, it is on the other side than La Boqueria. It has some surreal elements like the Dragon. It is nice but face it Barcelona has to offer much more and interesting architecture like Casa Batlo and Sagrada or the Gothic Quarter. One tip, you can see the umbrella below the dragon, apparently it was there because it was an Umbrella shop", "publishedDate": "2015-05-20", "language": "en", "rating": 3}]}}]
