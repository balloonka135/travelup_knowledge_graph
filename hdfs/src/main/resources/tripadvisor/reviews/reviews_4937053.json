This beautiful modernist building has a touch of Italian renaissance and the most notable part is the top of the house which is decorated with large mosaics presenting the invention of the printing press.", "publishedDate": "2016-01-24", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 212310473, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4937053-r212310473-Palau_Montaner-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Only open on Sat mornings for a guided English tour but well worth doing, maybe on the same day as Muntaner's masterpiece-the Catalan music hall in St Pere, nearby. Not every modernist masterpiece in Barcelona is by Gaudi and you should compare and contrast other great modernist architects from the same period.
