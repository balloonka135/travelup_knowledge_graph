That was my first vis-a-vis encounter with Frank\u2019s Architectural works. On my Review for that work I needed to confess that I never heard about this architectural masterpiece by the renowned -Toronto native architect- Frank Gehry. I was obliged state it\u2019s an \u201cARCHITECTURAL MASTERPIECE....\u201d. Noting that this wonderful masterpiece of modern architecture will impact even the guests to that Museum that does not care for architectural works. With its exterior facade and volumes that seems to overflow like an UFO, from the very top of the sidewalk, with its multiple curved structure of crystal panels, making an envelope for the old solid concrete structure building that had been gracefully adapted and redesigned with clear and fluent functionalism by Gehrig...\nSTUNNING DESIGN...SIMPLY A WORK OF A GENIUS ! \nMany says that, rather than a \u201ctumultuously elaborated creation\u201d, this may be one of Frank\u2019s \u201cmost gentle and self-possessed designs\u201d. \nBeen myself an old architect I had enjoyed his works in LA and now, as part of a longtime planned and cherished Gastrotour of (almost) all Spain...we are scheduled to visit-after Barcelona- two of his great works in Spain; \u201cMarques de Riscal\u201d and his well known \u201cGuggenheim\u201d Museum at Bilbao. \nFrank\u2019s buildings are both; kind of experimental creations plus \u201ctransformative\u201d (transformers like) ones, but always keeping the sense where they are created.\nHis boldish designs have led to call him:\n\u201cTHE...most important architect of our age\u201d !\nWe were in the great city of Barcelona...our first Gastrotour Stop. \nOur Agenda, besides the finest and top restaurants, included \u201cmandatory\u201d visits to the creations of Antoni Gaudi. Another genius on Architecture, my field of professional work, with creations-similarly to Gehry-greater than his times  \n\nI heard so many things about Gehry\u2019s \u201cPeix\u201d (Fish), here at Barcelona, that I needed to visit it...to better appreciate (as arts lover) that work. \nIt was our last day at Barcelona and we took good advantage of having that day, already with us, our rented BMW...a car that would be traveling with us, over 4,000 kms (almost), all over Spain; from Barcelona to La Rioja. From there to Pais Vasco and later on to Ribera del Duero and Galicia\u2019s Rias Baixas. After that was Porto and from Porto our trip would end in majestic Madrid...via Monumental city of Caceres. \n\nIt was a rainy day, but we didn\u2019t care; we were joyfully driving all over Barcelona including-of course- its beautiful renovated seaside areas...were that fish has become one of the symbols of post-Olympic\u00a0Barcelona. In someways was a petty that we had no-sunshine as  it is interesting how the sunlight gets reflected into the scales of that large scale \u201cPeix\u201d \nIs important to note that this was the first Gehry project experimenting with the computer to help him design its curve form and build its complicated structure. \nusing stainless steel that, at the same time, is supported by a metal structure\nWith a perfect location on the beachfront, that giant \u201cPeix\u201d (120 ft x 100 ft approx) is today one of the city\u2019s most beloved landmarks...among a city of many-many historic ones \nMany say that in many ways- it is a good way to remind -Cities resting next to the Sea- how lucky they are to have it, as it is here-in Barcelona-a wonderful City...City of great arts and fantastic gastronomic places...bathe by the Mediterranean sea.\nI\u2019m obliged to comment that this thoughts are-similarly- good to ourselves...living in Santo Domingo City with a long-beautiful \u201cMalecon\u201d, right on the Caribbean Sea...but its a painful true to notice and accept-as architect- that we live giving our backs to that Sea...taking it for granted.", "publishedDate": "2018-06-13", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 583841635, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7148963-r583841635-Gold_Fish_Sculpture_Escultura_el_Peix_d_Or-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This a large piece of artwork measuring 56m in length and 35m in height.
