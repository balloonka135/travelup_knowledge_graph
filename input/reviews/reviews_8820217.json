The race this year was't so exciting at the top, but it had many fun moments with the other racers and teams.\n\nPlanning-wise, I felt that Barcelona offered a lot in terms of enjoyment and ease-of-access.\n\nWe were 4 adults and 1 child (1 couple, 1 dad + son (10) and 1 adult). We rented an apartment in town (Arago312), within minutes of walking of the station Barcelona Nord. At first we had planned to take the Sagales bus for ease of travel, but we tried out the train for qualifications and it was very convenient, smooth and a lot cheaper too, most of all if you get a pass for a few days which also allows you to travel to the airport, as well as around the city. \n\nWalking from the train station to the track isn't that long and it allows you to pick up a sandwich and some drinks for the day, saving a few euros.\n\nWe sat in the SuperFan stands L and had a really great view of the track, allowing us to see turns 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, which means the first turns from the start. We saw quit a bit of actions during qualifications and race, as well as the other racing events. It was easy to access from Entrance 6, which might be the closest to the train station.\n\nFacilities were good, there was plenty of toilets and stands, though there could have been more ice cream vendors.\n\nOverall, it was a great trip, with Barcelona being a great location for the evening activities, even though you wouldn't have been able to tell there was a F1 race in the city, as there were no banners or anything marketing the event at all.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-02", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 680813089, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8820217-r680813089-F1_Spanish_Grand_Prix-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Wrote a separate review about the service.

Sadly there were no shuttle buses on the Thurs for the Pitwalk so we had a 40 min walk to the track, but the buses were running every other day to and from the station.  What we didn't find out til the last day was that instead of buying 2 returns for E10.20, which was still relatively cheap, we could buy a T10 book for E14.70 which is for 10 journeys and as many people as you like can use it, so on the sunday 5 of us used it to go to the track and back, so that was excellent value.  You are told before you go there is no alcohol on the track, and it's no different to any other race venue where food and drink is going to be expensive and you can take your own in so it is what you make it.

We got there early to check out the track (Sunday ticket only) and left the majority of our things in the car. Not only were we stopped by police when we attempted to leave (friendly but concerned) but when they brought us to a ticket collector to determine if we could re-enter, his response was \u201cwhy?\u201d As if no one had ever done this before (keeping in mind, we were parked at the outside bar). We explained we left something in the car and he said okay. When we got back to the gate we decided it would be best to go back to the man that told us it was okay to leave - and good thing we did. Luckily he remembered us because our tickets no longer worked. There were no passes given to us as I had read happened in previous years. I don\u2019t know if this is a new rule but it would have been pretty devastating had he not recalled us asking to leave. \n\nAll in all, a great time aside from the soap and maybe the re-entry rules should be clarified. \n\nI would recommend getting there around 9:45 to choose your spot (GA) and still have time to enjoy the track atmosphere.

Although I\u2019ve been to many races before, this was my first visit to the Barcelona GP. All in all we had a fantastic weekend, but there were both good and bad points:\n\nGood:\n- As an F1 fan, the track is excellent. Weekend grand stand tickets aren\u2019t actually very expensive and you get very good views from everywhere. I can recommend grandstand B and G lots as you can see all of turn 10 and onwards.  \n- It\u2019s possible to walk the entire track as there is a pathway that runs all around, not something you can always do and is a good way of spending time between track sessions. \n- General admission seems very popular and I was surprised at how good the views were for the cheapest way to see the Grand Prix. \n- The track is open after the race on Sunday to walk across. Particularly fun! \n- Travel back to Barcelona seems very easy as there were lots of buses. \n\nBad:\n- There are no water facilities. If you bring water and drink it all, you CANNOT fill up a bottle anywhere. \n- If you buy any bottled drinks (coke, water etc) they take the bottle caps for \u2018safety reasons\u2019. The staff know it\u2019s ridiculous but are forced to do it. \n- The circuit is dry and so you cannot buy any alcohol or bring it in with you. You may also not bring any cans in either, even if they\u2019re cans of coke. \n- The security organisation was terrible. On the Friday we queued over an hour to get in because there was only one man checking bags, despite 2 people checking tickets! Plus, depending on what day and gate you entered, sometime you could keep the bottle cap to your water bottle, sometimes not. Bringing 3 2ltr bottles of water to drink all day and being told you have to lose the caps at the gate is not very enjoyable. \n- Travel anywhere north at the end of the day is much more difficult. We stayed in Granollers and ended up walking back every day. \n\nOverall we had an excellent weekend. We were happy to go without beer whilst watching the race and we\u2019re fit enough to walk 5km home everyday. Just remember to bring lots of water and pray that you keep your bottle caps!

We have been to other races and this Grand Prix  ranked up there with our other experiences. \n\nWe had 3-day tickets and took the bus to the circuit each day. This is the preferable means of transportation as the bus lets you out about a quarter of a mile from gates 4 and 5. The buses are well-run, air-conditioned and efficient. They have this down to a fine art. Also, if you have 3-day tickets, you can go to the Pitwalk on Thursday which is always fun. Lewis Hamilton made an appearance in his pit to sign autographs.\n\nOur seats were at the end of the front straight with views of turns 2 and 3 and they were perfect! The price for the seats was reasonable. These were seats, not bench seating as we've had at other venues. Toilets were plentiful and directly beneath the stands.\n\nWhen people tell you to bring sunscreen, they are not kidding. The sun is relentless. This year there was a constant breeze which helped. If you are bringing a hat, heed that previous statement because you will need to make sure that you can secure your hat or you will lose it. \n\nEnjoy your fellow seat mates. One of the great joys of going to a Formula One race is getting to know other fans from other countries. Talk to the people around you. We were surrounded by people from Norway, Brazil, Spain and Britain. No matter your team, everyone is happy to be there.\n\nYou've read that there is a no alcoholic beverage policy. This is true. Security literally threw away a case of beer that a guy was trying to bring in. Unless you are well skilled at hiding your stash, I wouldn't recommend that you try. I do know that some people are successful because the Kimi Raikkonen fans singing and chanting at Friday practice were well toasted. \n\nThe food is disappointing. In a region renowned for its cuisine, this doesn't make sense. Don't order the hamburger.\n\nOne final and very important warning: watch your valuables. On Friday, the line to get into the circuit was long and very crowded. People were jostling each other in close quarters. Our friend had his wallet in his camera bag and it was stolen while we were in line. Not everyone in the line was actually going to the track. Some were taking advantage of the situation. Secure your valuables!\n\nHaving said all of that, going to the Spanish Grand Prix was a bucket list item. It did not disappoint!

There we got tickets for the local public transport. We knew that it was somewhere on the outside of Barcelona. And that getting there with the train would be the easiest way according to the F1 site. \n\nOn the first day we ordered tickets to the village we thought we should go to since no one at the main train station of Barcelona spoke English or seemed to know where the F1 would take place. \nSo we go a 10 point ticket for 2 zones because that was what we needed according to the maps. Then we chose the train. There were around 4 different companies with each more than 5 gates to check in. It look like it at least. Finally in the train we got to the village. But it was on the northern side of the village so the tickets weren't valid and we had to go back with another train after paying extra for valid tickets. \nThan we got to a station 4 km from the track after 1,5hours of traveling.\n\nFor the next times we chose to take a F1 coach to the circuit which we heard of from some friendly British people. \n\nSo it is some terrible organisation from the F1 side to get the people from Barcelona to the circuit. They at least could have said where to find that coach directly to it and put some people at the trainstation to give instructions.(even the information desk people didn't help.)\n\nOn site:\nOnce there, we looked for our seats on the grandstand. There were 3 numbers on our tickets that should help us figure out where to sit. Though we could not make sense out of the numbers on the stand so we asked. The guy we asked directed us to the seats although he didn't speak English. \nVery nice places just past the finish line with view over the first corner. Then Thursday we had the pit lane walk. They would let a sum of people walk through the pit lane one group after the other according to the website. Once there, everyone just walked straight on and there was no one to regulate it. People even walked back when they were half way down. That was horible organising. They could have easily let just a hundred or 200 people enter and leave each time and it would have been great but they didn't.\n\nQualifying:\nOn Saturday we went for the qualifying and we knew we needed some earplugs. So we looked for them. \nWe actually expected them to be given away at each stand but no 500 euro pp for the tickets is nothing but the seat! \nSo the cheap earplugs costed us a few euros. Then the food was around 4-5 euros and you could get it at the bottom of the stand so you wouldn't have to go through the stands check-in again. Still strange that all there people spend 500 euros for a plastic seat and still have to pay for drinks and food. I would at least give some free consumption tickets to each of them. One hamburger they even forgot the actual Hamburger i think is said enough about that organisation and quality.\n\nThe racing then:\nWe had great places because we could see the pit lane the finish line and the screens. Though the balustrade was halve way the track so half of it was difficult to see. Next to that, after the finish line the track bends just enough to make the first coroner disappear behind the stand. During the race the commentary was poor, i heared almost nothing of it. And when the podium ceremony began the interviews were very quiet like nobody should hear it and you should take binoculars with you.\n\nOwh and did I mention that the guy that showed us our seat (one of the crew) directed us to the wrong seats.\n\n I mean with this amount of service and organisation it should have cost nothing more than 100 euros.

We have been to Monaco twice, and Abu Dhabi, so had high expectations for Barcelona. We certainly weren't disappointed. The Circuit de Catalunya is a fantastic circuit, which gives you roaming access around the whole perimeter of the circuit. \n\nFor those with a weekend ticket, be aware that you can go to the circuit on the Thursday and have access to the pit lane and to meet some of the drivers, you will also get roaming access to any stand on the Friday, and to a lesser extent part of Saturday (FP3) but then need to be in you allocated seats for quali and the race itself.  We were also treated to a fully packed support card with F2, GP3 and the Porsche Supercup over the three day period. \n\nTransport:\nGetting to the track from central Barcelona couldn't be easier. Trains to Montmelo run regularly from Barcelona Sans and a three day pass for two will cost \u20ac14. The train ride is about half an hour. Once you get to Montmelo you have roughly a mile and a quarter walk to Gate 4 (main entrance next to the fan park and pit straight). Signs are up along the route to help direct you should you need it, however for us it was very much a case of following the crowd. We were at the circuit for 9:30 each day and getting the 8:01 train from Barcelona Sans. Best tip would be to go and get your ticket the day before though, we did and were grateful for it. \n\nGetting home was equally as easy, with only the Sunday being slightly busy. However, each day we stayed at the circuit for all support races, so had not got to battle with the huge crowds.\n\nCatering:\nLet's get this straight from the off... you are in a closed circuit, with 100,000 other folks, you are a captive audience with little other option than to pay premium prices for even the most basic of needs i.e. Water. Whilst there is plenty of choice, both to eat and to drink, nothing comes cheap. It was only on the last day we realised that you could bring food AND drink into the circuit. Therefore, rather than paying \u20ac3 for a 500ml bottle of water we paid \u20ac1 for an ice cold 1.5l bottle each and took it into the circuit. I wish we had planned this part better as we could have saved a lot of money over the three days by being prepared and taking our own stuff in.\n\nActivities:\nThere was so much to do and see over the three days, so much better than previous races we have been to. Racing simulators, pit stop challenges, gaming, TV presenting, a zip line along the main stand and getting to wave the chequered flag were just some of the activities available for you to partake in. Then throw in dance troupes, drummers, live music, DJs and the most fabulous robot, you couldn't fail to be entertained in between races. \n\nOverall:\nAfter Monaco and Abu Dhabi, I had been slightly sceptical about Barcelona, but I can guarantee this will not be our only visit there. Brilliant.

The walk to the circuit took a bit of time especially on race day due to all the security checks on the gate, but maximum 20 minutes from getting off the coach to getting into the circuit. The circuit itself is alcohol free which I saw as a positive thing. For the ladies there are plenty of toilets, basic but clean. The grandstands themselves are mostly open to the elements so come prepared with sun cream and/or rain macs. The atmosphere was electric, also very international, very good natured. There is also a village in the circuit with interactive things to do eg tyre change, zip wire. It is possible to access the general admission areas if you have a seated ticket, and that's also quite fun. There were good viewing spots on the grass verges.

Race day only.  We stayed in Barcelona and booked general admission (pelouse) through BookF1. Good communication from bookf1 and tickets arrived in plenty of time.  After trawling reviews decided to prebook the Sagales bus from Central Barcelona to the circuit.   In general admission there are only a couple of TVs screens to see so get there early. We got the bus around 7.45 and were seated in our place on the hill by 8.30 am. It was already quite crowded but people did keep filling the small gaps on the grass for a further couple of hours.  We had an excellent view of the TV screen between turn 8 and 9.  The whole trip was a birthday present  for my husband who is a big fan, I just tagged on so was a little worried about the amount of time we would be sitting around just waiting for the race to start!  I had plenty of time to see how the experienced pelouse fans set out their 'area' on the hill and have taken notes for next time!  The grass is prickly- take a towel to sit on, I was unable to find cheap beach towel in Barcelona on Saturday so we managed without but a towel helps, not only with comfort, but to layout your territory and without one we ended up in a very small space as the hill got busier. We did buy a beach umbrella and this provided much needed shade whilst waiting for events to begin. It was hot!  Not knowing what the catering would be like we took food and drink with us but there was a good choice of food at the circuit which I didn't think seemed too pricey although drinks were expensive and no alcohol allowed. Bags are searched on the way in. Toilet facilities plentiful and not too grim, but long queues for these and all food outlets in the couple of hours before race began. A F2 race and a Porsche race in the morning helped to pass the time and we took it in turns for a walkabout. Race was exciting (even for a non fan) but other reviewers can talk about that!  At the end of the race we made our way straight back to the main entrance for the bus back. As we sat half way round the track, and it's fair walk,  many thousands were out before us and I prepared myself for a very very  long wait for the bus. The queue Was so long it took a good few mins just to reach the end to join it, but 10 mins later we were on a bus and less than an hour after the end of the race we were back in the city centre.

The weather in May is very reliable and in the main, sunny and warm.  I'd recommend booking stand tickets - for a number of years, we booked general admission, however, in the last couple of years, the organisers have reduced the number of large screen TVs in the general admission areas which can make it difficult for race-goers to keep up with what is happening.  Also, since 2015 there has been a complete alcohol ban in the circuit - I have no idea why - which is a bit disappointing as it is always nice to have a glass of wine or beer while watching the race.  Don't be fooled when buying a pint of lager in the arena - it is priced as the alcoholic version, but is non-alcoholic.  It is possible to buy alcoholic drinks outside of the circuit which many people seem to do, before entering.  All bags are searched, so don't try to take your own drinks in with you.  Water and soft drinks in plastic bottles is allowed, but that is all.  It is possible to buy food and there is a good selection.  \n\nWe always take the bus to the race track, which takes you closer to the circuit than the train from Barcelona.

The access around the track was nice and easy to navigate and it was amazing to walk around a grand prix circuit on concrete.

It was an insult to pay for the bus to only be taken half way! And why does't the bus go from the train station?!
