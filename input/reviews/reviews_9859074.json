The monument sits in the middle of a busy roundabout. The actual roundabout isn\u2019t even that big as it\u2019s diameter is designed to be big enough to accommodate the monument. The road of the roundabout is about 20 metres wide in most places with no means of crossing to the monument/roundabout and I wouldn\u2019t even try. The closest you can physically get to the monument is one of the pedestrian crossing points.\n\nThe second reason I disagree with the 5 star ratings is that it\u2019s a fairly simple column with a statue of Jacint Verdaguer on top. The column is surrounded by a balustrade adorned with standing three allegorical sculptures and relief sculptures. As I had no intention of risking my life to get a closer look as the adornments, I was left with the only option of squinting my eyes to get a good look, followed by the zoom lens on my camera phone.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-13", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 676309202, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d9859074-r676309202-Monumento_a_Mosen_Jacint_Verdaguer-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Monumento a Mosen Jacint Verdaguer is an impressive monument to a local Catalan great man.
