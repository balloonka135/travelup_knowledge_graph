This park offers an excellent spot for hiking and relaxing with panoramic views of the city and very few tourists in sight.  There are various paths you can take to get to the top, and while steep, it is an easily doable hike for anyone in somewhat decent shape.  I would also suggest rambling through the hilly cobblestone streets around the base of the park; this residential area is full of beautiful buildings and is significantly quieter than the rest of the city.", "publishedDate": "2017-04-15", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 439187272, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d9882566-r439187272-Parque_del_Guinardo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I ran here lots during my stay near Guinardo hospital.

It is filled with trees and trails, and is a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. There is also an old air defence bunker in the centre. \n\nA nice bonus is the municipal funiculars that run up the hill to the park along Carrer de Sales i Ferr\u00e9.", "publishedDate": "2016-01-22", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
