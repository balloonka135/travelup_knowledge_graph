Honestly, the only reason why I decided to take it was because it was a means of quick transportation from Barceloneta to Montjuic. The old tower is easily seen from walking down the Barceloneta plaza strip, finding it was no problem. This company also goes by Telefericos de Barcelona S.A. and has goes from Barceloneta to the top of Montijuic, with a stop in the middle, however closed. \n\nWe arrived at ticket booth about 4:15pm, and the last car runs at 5:00pm. Obviously, we wouldn't have had enough time to see all of Montijuic and make it back before the last cable car departs, so I was expecting to only be purchasing a One Way Ticket. Being an obvious tourist, the very rude middle aged lady at the ticket booth decided to charge me for a Round Trip Ticket for both me and my husband! 16.50 euros each, which was supposed to be 11 euros! I found out that the European persons in line before AND after us all got One Way Tickets...this lady singled us out and took advantage of us! NOT COOL. \n\nOn top of that, the ride wasn't event worth it. Luckily, our wait wasn't that long, only a car ride wait as it was already about time for closing. However, they jam packed us in that car like sardines- there had to be 20 of us in that tiny little box. I was lucky enough to get a window view, but those in the middle, good luck. The actual ride was longer than I expected, and I did get some good views out of it. But this didn't hide the fact that every single worker, from the ticket booth lady to the man riding up the elevator with you, and the men packing you into the car booth--NONE of them have any kind of customer service at all, not even a grin. \n\nDO NOT confuse this with Telerific de Montjuic, which is run by another company and only runs up and down the Montjuic area. By the time we got to the top, we didn't realize that all the attractions (Castle de Montjuic, Magic Fountain, Palau de Montjuic) were all A LONG WALK away--unless you took this other cable car which would be another fee of 14 euros I believe. By then, we were over it. Found our way walking to the attractions up there. I DO NOT recommend at all.", "publishedDate": "2019-11-16", "language": "en", "rating": 1}, {"id": 726187670, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d17593156-r726187670-The_Port_Cable_Car-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Beautiful views but not worth 16.50 euros at all. \nStaff incredibly miserable and rude.

Cannot buy tickets in advance and obviously wait times can vary, but usually quite busy.  Only two cable cars, each holding 16 people, so a line of 100 people will take at least 45 minutes.  Beware, it can be deceptive, because at the port there is a line on the ground at the ticket window, but then another line once you get to the top of the tower. The view during the ride is nice, but it is very quick.\n\nAlso note it can be confusing because there are two different cable car rides.  This one (Teleferico del Puerto) goes from the port to the Montjuic park near the Miramar Hotel. The other (Teleferic de Montjuic) starts at the opposite side of the park and goes to the castle at top of the mountain.  \n\nThe park is large with a lot to do.  National Palace, Magic Fountain, Olympic Stadium, restaurants, beautiful views of the city.  But I would probably advise getting there a different way and to not waste time waiting on line.

If you have the time I'd recommend tackling both. However, the Port Cable Car was suggested by a work colleague for its fabulous views of the bay and she was right. It is well worth a visit.\n\nIt's pretty cheap to but a ticket. 11 Euros one way and 16 Euros return. Kids under 6 go free. You can get there by foot, on the local bus, the hop-on hop-off bus or by taxi. And of course, its a view you won't see anywhere else.\n\nWe visited on a fairly quiet day during half term in England. We had a 20 minute wait to purchase tickets, then another 30 minute wait to get on the cable car. However, at this point you are up the top of a very tall tower and the views are great, so the wait is not so much of a problem. You are crammed inside the car ride and so ensure you grab a window position even if you have to stand sideways.\n\nI imagine going here in the mid-day sun, when the whole top floor is full of people under glass, could cause no end of problems, heat exhaustion being one of them. There are no refreshment facilities on the floor though there appeared to be a toilet so take make sure you take your water.\n\nI'd reccommend going there early on in the day because I'm guessing the queues become 2 hr waits, judging by the miles of que ribbons winding back and forth. Tip -  If there's only a short queue at the ticket office downstairs, chances are the queue in in the tower is also fairly short. You have to travel by lift to reach the top.\n\nAnd finally, of course if its raining you won't see a thing.", "publishedDate": "2019-06-07", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
