You have to buy tickets to ' spend' on the stalls where local restaurants have made tapas. We drank delicious wine and ate many small portions of delicious food- croquettes, slow cooked lamb, olives etc. There are many wine stalls and places where you can buy cocktails and beer. There are information stands about wine tourism. There are also many stalls where you don't need the tickets. These sold everything from olive oils, honey and juices. It was a beautiful evening but extremely full and you might have to wait to get a place to stand at a table. It is definitely worth it though!
