Please do not expect authentic place, spot was made for tourist, but that doesn't mean it is not good. I can say I liked choice of smoothies (best for me was papaya-coconut from center booth), juices, fruits and sea-food.

Even if you are not buying, wind your way through the throngs (or go at 10am when it is not crowded) to check out the sights, it's worth the time.

You can purchase all kinds of fruits, exotic vegetables,  meats, sea food and other stuff like dry fruits, preserves etc. Lovely little market.
