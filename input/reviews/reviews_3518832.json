I had a small peep (10 minutes or so) and I found really interesting things in there from a range of artists. The lady who I spoke to (on the front desk) was helpful and friendly. I had a browse through the prints and they are very reasonably priced (suited for me as a student!) with prints starting at around 25 euros. I can\u2019t wait to go back!

It is truly incredible and we do not know how we can get back our money.

It was large and expensive (although very well-priced for the quality and size), and my husband and I weren't quite ready to make a decision. We were also nervous to deal with a business we had no knowledge of involving significant funds and shipping overseas.\n\nWe talked to one of the gallery associates, Chimera, who took my email address and said she would email me a photo of the piece as we considered its purchase. Chimera followed through exactly as she said she would. She made the process so seamless and took the fear out of buying a rather expensive item while traveling in a foreign country and getting it efficiently and safely transported. It arrived in less time than expected in perfect condition, and we are thrilled with the entire transaction.", "publishedDate": "2014-10-11", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 212572565, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d3518832-r212572565-Artevistas_Gallery-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Found this gallery by chance while on a walk.

I purchased work from the gallery in February 2013 and subsequently bought several pieces on-line. The staff at the gallery are attentive and offer a high quality service.

Excellent value for money and an establishment that should be visited during any visit to Barcelona.", "publishedDate": "2013-12-29", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
