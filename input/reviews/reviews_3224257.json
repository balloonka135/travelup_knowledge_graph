Once at the top, I climbed the steps to the main level of the church and followed the signs to the elevator to the upper terrace and the tower. The stairs to the tower were easy to climb and it is possible to get within a few feet of the \"feet of Jesus\" at the base of the statue. Although it was a bit hazy when I was there, the view was still magnificent, all the way to the Mediterranean. \n\nThe church has 2 sanctuaries, one above the other and both are nicely done. There are a number of vantagepoints around the building in all directions.
