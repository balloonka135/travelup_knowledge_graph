You don\u2019t want to mind waiting. Hundreds of people (maybe thousandso) need to show their ticket to just 1 or 2 hosts that will manually check your ticket. Then security, same limited number of staff and then the bonus: 1 man scanning your ticket and 1 man providing you a bracelet and then try to scan it a couple of times. Imagine 100.000 visitors in this inefficient process. \n\nWaiting for drinks is ok. Not sure if this is because of the high prices. \nWaiting for food however is a nightmare. Apart of the medium quality there is only 3 caravans with hotdogs and tortilla chips open. Again for 100.000 people. \nDidn\u2019t the organizers travel to festivals like in the Netherlands or Belgium to see how you do catering...? Might be a good advice. \n\nYou pay an extra 2\u20ac per glass deposit. After 3am there is only one booth open for refund. When you see more than 100 people standing in this line, you skip this and lose your refund. What a cash cow for them. \n\nAgain, great line up but poor organization.

The line up was amazing all the best DJ-s Armin, David Guetta, Robin Shultz, the Chainsmokers, Don Diablo, Axwell and many others. No selfiesticks allowed and many other things. Definitely get money topped up online, prior the festival to avoid the crowds. I went from 7 pm -7 am and had 100 euros on my account, shared some of the money with my friend. Had loads of water, around 5/6 run & cock and we ate twice too and I had 33.50 euros left.The atmosphere was amazing and we had a lot of fun. The downside that in the middle of the night in the main bar there was a massive queue of 100 people or more and only 3/4 staff members were serving. We waited 40 minutes and then went to another bar where got served pretty quickly, so they should have more staff next year. The festival is on the beach so it's full of dust in the air, your head and face, as everyone is dancing on the sand. I haven't seen any fights or drugs around, not even drugged people. I guess i just enjoyed the music so much that didn't have time to look around:). Going next year again for sure!!!", "publishedDate": "2018-07-17", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 594794604, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10020538-r594794604-Barcelona_Beach_Festival-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "120,000 people on the beach was amazing to see.

It was one of the best nights We have ever had and we will definitely be returning. The only downside was the lack of organisation at the main front gate. I would highly recommend you try this festival out, especially if you love EDM. Salud!", "publishedDate": "2017-07-21", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
