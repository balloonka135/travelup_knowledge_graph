Nevertheless there is probably plenty of space around it for people to congregate. The 100-year old fountain depicts the lovely sculpture of a young child holding a frog . The water runs from the frog's mouth. We some some people filling their bottles too! Not sure how good the water is! A nice spot and worth a stop, if you are passing by.", "publishedDate": "2019-09-24", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 689545258, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8685983-r689545258-La_font_de_la_Granota-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This is fountain dispensing potable water, and is located between Avinguda Diagonal and Jardi del Palau Robert. The main part of the fountain is large rectangular pedestal block of stone with relief sculptures of floral patterns on each side of the pedestal. The most interesting part of the fountain is the sculpture atop the pedestal, which features a sculpture of a boy lying on his stomach reaching down to grab a frog, held just about the fountain basic.\n\nWorth a quick detour if on Avinguda Diagonal or near Palau Robert.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-14", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 676413231, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8685983-r676413231-La_font_de_la_Granota-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Lovely sculpture of a girl holding tightly to a frog, glad I got to see it but I\u2019m not sure what its relevance is.
