We saw a long queue outside the Picasso museum and was wondering what to do, our 8 year old son wanted to go so we have decided to go. Their permanent collection which have variety of exhibits from all over the world are beautifully presented and easy to browse around, Even if you don't have any interest in the area you will appreciate the beautiful and unique exhibits. In addition to all the collection, the museum itself has been resotored beautifully and I was busy checking out their different woodworks of the ceilings in different rooms. It was very quiet and not many people around. It was air conditioned everywhere so we cooled ourselves down from the heat outside.", "publishedDate": "2015-07-26", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 288051406, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7820170-r288051406-Museum_of_World_Cultures-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The most extraordinary and beautifully curated exhibition of world indigenous artefacts I have ever seen.

Everything is new and clean. The explanations in Catalan, Spanish and English are very detailed and the lighting is really good - it's just me or there are lots of museums out there with poor and/or strange illumination?\n\nThe exhibition is split in four: you start with Africa, then walk through Oceania, Asia (the biggest part) and America in the end. While there are fewer pieces than in other ethnographic museums we've been to (like Muse\u00e9 Du Quay Branly in Paris), it is a good selection and everything is well represented, especially Papua New Guinea and India.\n \nWe loved the \"Research room\", where they have five computers filled with traditional music, videos and all kind of information to complete and expand what you see on the displays. There is also a little \"cinema\" (a big screen with seats in front of it) where you can watch short stories from all around the world (in Catalan, Spanish, English and French), about 5 minutes each. They are kid-oriented but we liked them very much, give it a try!\n\nThe buildings where the museum is located are like another piece of art. Very similar to the one that hosts the Picasso Museum, they tell the story of the old Barcelona, from medieval times to the present: there are some scattered panels through the museum with explanations about the rooms.\n\nCons: Nothing. Well, the temperature of the air-conditioning was set too low for me, but I'm always cold, so you'll probably be OK. Anyway, I don't know if it has something to do with the conservation, but bring a jacket if you happen to be like me :)\n\nPractical tips: Lockers available (the big ones can fit a suitcase).\n\nFree wi-fi spots all around the museum. \n\nCompletely wheelchair-friendly, and also adapted for deaf and blind people.\n\nFree on Sunday afternoons and evenings (15h - 20h).\n\nSave at least two hours, three if you can!\n\nGreat location, just in front of Picasso Museum.\n\nOverall: We loved it! It's very new (just opened in January this year) but it totally deserves to become one of the most visited museums in Barcelona. Just go there and see it by yourself!", "publishedDate": "2015-07-05", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 269284981, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7820170-r269284981-Museum_of_World_Cultures-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We stumbled across this museum because we were going to the Picasso museum (they are opposite each other).
