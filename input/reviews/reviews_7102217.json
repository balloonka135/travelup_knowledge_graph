With some of the obvious and subtle racism I have faced as a black man touring Europe, such kind gestures can completely surprise you.\n\nAnyways the cemetery itself is not large with a rectangular layout and for me quite different since all previous cemeteries I have visited have the dead below ground. This had the dead entombed in walls of crypts above ground. The place was very colorful with lots of pictures of the dead, flowers, etc adorning the crypts and lots of sculptures. There were ladders around to reach the upper crypts.\n\nI nearly wept when I observed an older lady praying at the crypt of someone. She clearly was overcome with emotion. I took quite a few pictures including the required selfie with the \"Pet\u00f3 de la mort\" (Kiss of Death).\n\nUnfortunately because I had wasted time finding the cemetery, I was pressed for time and could not explore it enough before the 6 PM closing.", "publishedDate": "2016-12-07", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 430693557, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7102217-r430693557-Poblenou_Cemetery-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Very interesting how they are buried in Spain.

Respectively admiring them is a way to honour the dead and have them live on beyond the love ones they left behind. The works of art in cemeteries are built to be admired and looked upon. And this cemetery is filled with amazing works. I could have spent another 2 hours simply wandering in this beautiful place.

Obviously the Kiss of Death being the most famous looked wonderful and tinged with sadness of the extinguishing of a young life, but the sadness was lifted somewhat by the gorgeous pink flowers growing through both sculptures. I also thought the Angel carrying the woman upwards was a beautiful representation of life/death journey.  \n\nOne of the stand out monuments for me was of the statue of the young man dressed in T-shirt & Jeans with sunglasses in shirt pocket, bottle in the other hand, covered in pink and white flowers.
