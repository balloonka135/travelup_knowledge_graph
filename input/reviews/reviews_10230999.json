We were about the only ones clothed. If you\u2019re open minded and it\u2019s not busy it\u2019s a real nice beach. Some naked guys were getting a bit friendly with each other in view of everyone so if you can turn a blind eye you\u2019ll be fine. If not, definitely go to the beach up the road 5 minute away.

About half of La Mar bella is designated nudist and the signs are clearly visible.  We spent a lot of time on this beach because our hotel was right in front of the beach.  Being long time Nudists, we found the beach to be extremely nice.  Though it is a nudist beach, about 40 percent were nude and another 30 percent were topless.  The rest were clothed.  This is probably because a majority were tourists and unfamiliar or uncomfortable with nudity.  The beach is narrow at the south end and widens considerably near the beach bar BeGay.  The water in July was warm and refreshing.  The beach is sandy and clean.  The sand extends for a while into the water and there were few rocks or  algae or shells. There are also the occasional beach vendor that would come by selling everything from Sangria to beer to vodka and water.  The beach is well patrolled by life guards as well as police.  Overall, the beach was a great place to people watch and get a great all over tan.  It can be a bit crowded at times but we found that people were respectful.
