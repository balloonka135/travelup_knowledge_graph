The park is home to Dona i Ocell, which I found more captivating in person than I had expected. However, the BIG attraction is not the art but the living. If you are looking for a botanical wonderland inspired by Joan Mir\u00f3\u2019s great works, you should keep looking. If, however, you are looking for a peaceful afternoon amongst and with the locals, this park is a gem! \n\nThe park is split roughly in half by a wide, even walking path festooned by vibrant flora (primarily bougainvillea). The Dona is well-displayed with a reflecting pool in a corner on one side of the park, where it abuts a shaded pavilion-performance area. The rest of that side of park has a landscaped area with lawns, which have a lot of central wear due to both dogs and children at play, and some courts for ball sports. (Didn\u2019t look closely enough to be able to say what kind - sorry!)\n\nMain features on the other side of the park are the library, a water feature (that is currently drained so not 100% sure if just for viewing), and play spaces for all ages. The grounds (aside from those previously mentioned) are sand, dotted with palms for shade, occasional other shrubs (particularly in a section I think of as the \u2018reading/meditation zone\u2019, and benches. There is a reasonably-sized enclosed dog play area, a large space for ~6 volleyball nets/games (2 happening while we were there), a section with ~6 table tennis tables (2 in use while we were there), a section for ~4 courts for a smaller yard/ground sport (perhaps p\u00e9tanque??), at least 4 playgrounds/play structures for children of differing ages, a zip line for children, and probably more. \n\nWe were there in a drizzle around 5pm on a cool Sunday, and the park positively teemed with locals and good cheer. We look forward to coming back for more afternoon fun throughout the week, which can then wrap up with tapas at La Terraza Mir\u00f3 - exceptional on all counts and perfectly located under the watchful presence of Dona i Ocell!", "publishedDate": "2019-05-19", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 674592636, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d6116899-r674592636-Park_of_Joan_Miro-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "When we first saw Park of Joan Miro we did not realise it was actually a park.

Started in 1979  on the demolition of the old city slaughterhouse.   It is the space of 4 city blocks and dominated by the huge and colourful Joan Miro statue called woman and bird.  It is standing in a pool of water.  Much loved by the local dogs and their owners.   It's fun to see how much the dogs enjoy being in the water!   There is a lawned area with a \"river\" of taller flowering grasses snaking across the middle.  Also an area of palm trees which seemed to be loved by a flock of green and noisy parrots!   To the side are some wonderful flowering bougainvilleas and pale blue plumbago.  All in all a really nice and welcome open space.

The park is spacious and quiet, even with the hub of activity from the nearby plaza and metro.  The Miro sculpture, Woman and Bird, is especially fun to see!
