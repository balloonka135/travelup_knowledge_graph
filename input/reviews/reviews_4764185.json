If you like urban art, this should be your destination...in a great part of town (you can swing by after seeing the Cathedral and Plaza St. Jaume -- it's right behind it) Robert's gallery is covered floor to ceiling with striking and original pieces, and he's got boxes of small prints, some by famed graffiti artists like Pez that are really affordable and fun to browse through. I always find that I find something original that speaks to me in his collection of art, in contrast to other places that I've walked in and out of because they just felt too commercial. Highly recommend this great gallery.", "publishedDate": "2013-10-22", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 180445846, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4764185-r180445846-Base_Elements_Urban_Art_Gallery-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Just arrived in Barcelona, with no thought about art we stumbled across Base Elements Urban Art Gallery, the first thing I noticed was some paintings of a happy fish!! \n\nI talked with Robert and he showed me some of the different works by el Pez, and I couldn't forget about them after we left the shop.\n\nDuring our week in Barcelona we saw several of El Pez pieces on doors and walls around the town and I knew I couldn't go home without one of my own!!!\n\nSo the evening before departure I went and bought a 35 by 35 cm piece of original el Pez graffiti :-)\nI am so happy to have it in my home and can't stop smiling every time I look at it.\n\nThanks to Robert for his patience showing me all the different paintings in his gallery, I know that I will come back there next time I'm in Barelona", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 180270194, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4764185-r180270194-Base_Elements_Urban_Art_Gallery-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "By accident we found this gallery and we stopped by to see the art.

Lovely work by great urban/street artists.. You can see their work through the whole city, but Robert seems to be able to have the artists 'gallery' work. The gallery in itself is also beautiful with also a large basement which shows even more work.. Definitely  gonna hop by on my next visit to Bcn..", "publishedDate": "2013-10-04", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 177874747, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4764185-r177874747-Base_Elements_Urban_Art_Gallery-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Robert Burt was in when me and my wife stopped in. He was very helpful and showed us a lot of different artist who he knew a lot about. The artwork and choice of artists were amazing. we wished we had more time but we were only in Barcelona for one night and had a lot on our list. Every time we come back though we will stop in. Must stop in, even for a couple minutes. Thanks again Robert if your reading this!", "publishedDate": "2013-09-20", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
