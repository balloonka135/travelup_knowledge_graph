He designed the Barcelona Pavilion for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition.  The pavilion is small and can be visited in 30-45 minutes.  It is about 2 blocks from the Magic Fountain and it is easy to work a visit into a Montjuic Area Sights Walking Tour. This is an important building in the Modernist style and is interesting to see, even if you are not a big architecture fan.  Van der Rohe used lavish materials and a simple design for impressive visual impact.
