Slightly wild which I think is the intention, too much to keep spotlessly tidy. We didn't fully look around this garden as we were moving on to another garden we wanted to see. So a return visit one day. \nThe musical bellows were fun even for the bigger kids.\nMore than one entrance, probably the easiest from the Montjuic funicular.", "publishedDate": "2017-06-25", "language": "en", "rating": 3}]}}]
