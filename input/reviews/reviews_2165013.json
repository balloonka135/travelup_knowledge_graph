We walked around the castle to find a view of the setting sun, but it's hard to find any spot as the trees are too tall and blocks the view of the horizon. I guess all the views are reserved for people who actually go inside the castle  Eventually we did find one spot after walking around the whole castle where we could see the sunset. A few other people were also there at that spot as well. There is an admission fee to enter the castle (but as we didn't go in I don't recall the price). The surrounding area around the castle is free admission. We walked down a little from the castle and found a bus stop where there were some buses that went to downtown Barcelona area where we found a metro station.
