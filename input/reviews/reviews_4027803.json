The Centro Comercial Arenas De Barcelona answered that question for me\u2014convert the bullring into a shopping center! While in Barcelona, I learned that the impressive conversion of this former bullring took approximately 8 years and was finally completed in 2011. This relatively new shopping center includes food courts, cinemas and even venues for music performances and flamenco shows.

This middle-class shopping mall houses more than 110 shops, restaurants, a gym and a 12-screens cinema over 4 floors.

(You could also take the lift to get up there & it only costs 1 Euro.) There are also a number of restaurants or bars on the rooftop for visitors to enjoy the view. However, in my opinion, the most attractive\u00a0parts of this shopping arena are:\u00a0\n1) the circle centre in the middle of the shopping mall: Sometimes the overhead projector would turn it into a colourful dancing floor but most of the times it would be used as an exhibition\u00a0hub.\u00a0\n2) the food court on the lower ground floor: there are a variety of local food stalls which you would definitely find something which suits your stomach.
