A lot of reviews say it\u2019s ugly and non functional, I disagree. There\u2019s isn\u2019t any sand, and there is a concrete break water to make a nice little inlet for swimming. No waves, like a natural little pool. There was also a mechanical wake boarding course you could do. There was a small snack shop and showers, etc. may look like a concrete jungle-which it is, but if I lived in Barcelona I would make that place a habit-it was so empty and quiet.

It actually has a lot of wobbly paving stones which catch you out and spray you with muddy water (if it's been raining), but that aside the sea as a backdrop to a festival is perfect and the purpose built festival arena accommodates stages of varying sizes and shapes, and it's right next to a Metro station. There was torrential rain in May when we visited and the site is prone to large puddles, as it is very uneven, but the organisers of Primavera Sound coped so well with this that it didn't matter all.
