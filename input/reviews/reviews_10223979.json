There are supposed to be six rooms of exhibits, but on the day I visited, the museum, only one of the exhibitions was open. The exhibition was on Carme Ruscalleda  a 3 michelin starred head chef of the restaurant Sant Pau, specialising in Catalan cooking. Plenty of descriptions in Spanish, English and (I think) French, same goes the video documentary on the restaurant.\n\nShame the other exhibitions were closed, but I still enjoyed the one that was open.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-14", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 672101379, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10223979-r672101379-Palau_Robert-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This neoclassical palace built in 1903 is located at the intersection of Passeig de Gracia and Avinguda Diagonal.\n\nIt is a former private residence but now it is a public museum with free admission.

It's free and usually has a photography exhibit (currently Outumuro). It also houses a tourist office.  But, for me, the most lovely surprise is the beautiful little park at the back of the building.
