Before you pay, you have to check whether you can collect points on your purchase because some merchandise and brands are excluded. Two, check  whether you can use the credit points to offset your purchase. Again, certain brands are excluded.

This store has items throughout its website that say click express.  HOME DELIVERY IN 2 HOURS OR THE TIME YOU WANT - is what is advertised.  All the items I selected were available as quick express.  I ordered at 400 a.m. US time which is 11 a.m. Barcelona time.\n\nStore said delivery between 1 and 3 p.m. Barcelona time.  No delivery occurred.  I spent better part of day sending emails to this company.  No emails ever returned.  I sought out their face book page who said they would get back to me.  No one has.  I even left message for them on Instagram.\n\nUnlike in the US where you have choice between English and Spanish there are not English options when you call the numbers available.\n\nSo its now day 3 of my Girlfriends stay and my surprise has still not been delivered.  The store it is coming from a manager could have walked it to her and left it  No call, no emails, no response from anyone but they had no problem taking the extra money for 2 hr shipping that never occurred.  \n\nI provided my girlfriends cell phone, my cell and work phone, both my work and home emails and other than they received, placed, and allegedly shipped the order I have not talked to one person.  For a store that carries luxury line products and supposed to have good customer service if I could rate them lest than terrible I would.\n\nI will not recommend them at all to anyone looking for delivery of goods from their website.", "publishedDate": "2019-12-04", "language": "en", "rating": 1}, {"id": 728026355, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8036442-r728026355-El_Corte_Ingles-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We needed a few things during our stay and this huge store worked as a one-stop for purchases.
