It is not as well known as \"La Sagrada Familia\", but it is a very beautiful and impressive church. And it is much more than a church, it is an imposing building, worth to visit, even when not religious. It is definitely worth a visit. \nThe interior, with its 3 naves, shines wonderfully in the sunlight and is impressively designed with many decorations and with a lot of love for details. At the Catedral de la Santa Creu i Santa Eul\u00e0lia you can find many epochs of European architecture - whether romantic or Gothic.\nBesides everything, the cloister (inner courtyard) with its palm trees, the fountain and the swans is a special impression for me.\n\nThe roof is accessible and can be reached via an elevator at the Porta de Sant Iu. It offers a great view of the city, hinterland and sea. A great sight especially at sunrise and sunset.\nThe bags are checked upon entry and you must wear sleeveless, knee-length clothing. So it takes a few minutes to get to the church.\n\nIn summer on the small square in front of the cathedral spontaneous Catalan dances of the ordinary people take place every Sunday morning (\"'Sardanes\"). A few musicians play Catalan music.", "publishedDate": "2020-04-04", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 751753089, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d191048-r751753089-Barcelona_Cathedral-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I think that La Sagrada Familia gets most of the attention in Barcelona, but this cathedral deserves more.

According to record, Christian baptistry was first established here in the 6th century. Later, it was replaced by Romanesque in the 11th century before it became the current Gothic cathedral. Although this is not the most famous landmark in Barcelona, but it is still the most important cathedral in the Gothic Quarter. The main attractions for the Cathedral are:\ni) The Facade: The carved sculptures and the stained-glass windows at the entrance and the twin towers are stunning. It's particularly picturesque under the sunset.\nii) The Nave and Organ: This 16th-century nave is massive and its arches are looming over its Gothic buttresses and a series of beautiful chapels.\niii) The Choirstalls: The colourful goldern and green choirstall is one of the most beautiful features inside the cathedral.\u00a0\niv) Centre Crypt: Where it lies 1,327 alabaster sarcophagus of\u00a0Santa Eul\u00e0ria.\nv) The Christ of Lepanto: Inside this 15th-century chapel, it features the legend who guided the Christian fleet in 16th century battle against the Ottoman Empire.\nvi) The Rooftop: With no extra cost, you can use the lift (i.e. which is behind the Choirstalls, on the left-hand side) to take you to the rooftop to give you a bird's eye view of the beautiful neighbourhood of the Gothic Quarter.\nvii) The internal garden: It's a nice & restful place to visit once you're inside the cathedral. You can also see some gooses, a fountain and some lovely trees inside this 14th-century garden.\nWe had a good time in the cathedral and it's highly recommended if you're nearby.\nTips:\u00a0\n1) The tickets are sold inside the cathedral so there's no need to go to the unofficial \"tickets office\" (i.e. just outside the cathedral) to purchase tickets. Each ticket cost 7 Euro.\u00a0\n2) There is a toilet inside the internal garden but it'd cost about 20 or 50 cents.
