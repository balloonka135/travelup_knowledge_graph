The fountain reminds me of a gravestone with rounded top and shoulders, which immediately make the fountain a little unappealing. Atop the fountain is a statue inspired by the fairytale of The Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s okay. If you happen to be on Avinguda Diagonal and close to Sagrada Familia, then it\u2019s only worth a detour if you have time, but I wouldn\u2019t go out of the way. I do have a penchant for childhood nostalgia, so I took a 2 minute detour to see it.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-13", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 479373948, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d9608985-r479373948-Font_De_La_Caputxeta_Vermella-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "If you have to walk around it's ok to see, but don't make an special time to do it.
