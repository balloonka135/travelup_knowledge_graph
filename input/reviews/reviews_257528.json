I also heart a lot about La Caixa as almost a \"world class institution\" ( as least I consider them highly) but I was actually severely disappointed by CaixaForum in Barcelona.\n\nWent there today for the first time and they had three expositions ;\n\n1) something on modern art - one small room and really pathetic - can't believe CaixaForum set's up something so basic like that\n\n2) drawings in/about Versailles - was ok, a bit boring as just carbon drawings and while perhaps not exactly what I appreciate the most, I didn't think it was anything impressive at all but was acceptable and therefore ok\n\n3) something on Egypt, power symbols and Falcons - admittedly this part was quite ok and interesting collection of artefacts ! Was worth visiting - nothing really memorable and really impressive on the whole but was nice and would recommend. However this section did have a very odd, confusing and strange layout - and walking through made the whole experience quite a bit less optimal and didn't do justice to the pieces or art and artifices on show. It was 15-17 degrees outside (so neither warm not cold) - the permanent air conditioning quite noisy and the ceiling giving an odd feeling to the whole experience. There was definitely an uncomfortable atmosphere in a building that is relatively new / newly refurbished.\n\nI really love modernistic buildings - and especially all those in barcelona, I also love good industrial architecture and the work of good architects, but this was one of the very few buildings I have seen in my life that have actually let me down. Not a nice building to start with (really hard to say for barcelona but that is actually true for this old factory). I have seen fantastic conversions of great industrials buildings and like those a lot but this one is just horrible and a huge disappointment in terms of building, cozyness and suitability for a museum - the architect was this conversation did really an unimpressive work - in fact a lousy work.\n\nAlso, the whole forum is more geared towards the \"mass market\" and kids playground and experience - absolutely nothing wrong with that but just keep that in mind in case you where expecting something more  exquisite  and impressive. But even in that mass market/kids space I have seen much more memorable and enjoyable buildings and forums/museums.\n\nI am very sorry to say - but this building and forum was a huge let down and real disappointment. I could hardly believe Caixa is behind that and suggest some serious thought on improving the site/building and artistic layout of expositions - all quite substandard and cheap  really.\n\nI won't go there again and can not recommend going to this one - really plenty of really phantastic stuff one can do and see in barcelona but this one you can skip in my opinion.\n", "publishedDate": "2016-01-12", "language": "en", "rating": 2}, {"id": 338745672, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d257528-r338745672-CaixaForum-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The exhibitions here are real exhibitions interesting for the locals as well.
