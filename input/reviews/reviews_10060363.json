The statue depicts Gandhi wearing simple dhoti and shawl, and circular glass for which he is usually remembered. I think the statue is smaller than real life as the statue is less than 1.5 metres tall.\n\nI\u2019m a admirer of the great man and was delighted to see this statue when I least expected it.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-12", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 677103200, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10060363-r677103200-Monumento_a_Mahatama_Gandi-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I quite liked the fact that the lovely memorial statue of Gandhi was next to a park where I saw a lot of teenagers congregated. It is a lovely park and the statue I think highlights and gives the children the opportunity to ask questions and be curious about the iconic figure that was Gandhi and it\u2019s presence in the area is lovely.

We walked to see it. It was less than impressive. The statue was nice but not presented very well, in my opinion. Not something I would recommend.
