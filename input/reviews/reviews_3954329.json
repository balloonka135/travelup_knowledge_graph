If you\u2019re a fan of everything medieval, you\u2019ll be in awe. The church was founded in 900-1000 AD, and renovated in the 13th century (maybe some minor renovations afterwards, but they were done really well). Basically, the current look dates back to 13th century.\nBe careful, some beggars are usually sitting outside and asking for money.\nWhen we entered, there was an elderly ticket lady who spoke English. The entrance fee is 3 euros per person, 1,5 euros for students. We gave her the money and she gave as a booklet an English about with a story of the place, and showed us the way. Basically, you enter the old stone yard, and then you can proceed to the church itself. There are not many people there, in fact we stayed in the church for 15 minutes all by ourselves, which was great. Old Gregorian chants were played (not real, but recorded ones) and added to the atmosphere. \nThe territory open for tourists is small, but it\u2019s enough. You can walk around and explore the old engravings, some interesting elements on the walls. Don\u2019t forget to go to the small yard and to look at the church outside. \nTo me, this was an unforgettable experience. I felt something special here.
