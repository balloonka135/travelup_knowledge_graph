This Olympic Stadium appeared to be the largest facility at the Olympic Complex. \n\nFortunately for the Olympic planners in Barcelona, they did not have to build a brand new stadium for the 1992 Summer Olympics. The Estadi Olimpic was actually built in 1927 for the 1929 International Exposition. Though it had fallen into disrepair by the 1970s, it was renovated once Barcelona was awarded the 1992 Summer Olympics. When I visited, it was very well maintained.

HOLY MOLY! This was so high on my to do list when visiting Barcelona, you can't even imagine. Although it's a popular spot to visit, for me especially being as Olympic-obsessed as I am, it was pure gold (see what I did there?).\n\nThe Barcelona Olympics were one of the few in Olympics history that didn't financially debilitate the city hosting the games. Barcelona was smart. They invested money in the infrastructure they already had instead of simply building from the ground up. This resulted in a more modern Barcelona for its citizens and not just a fancy setting for an Olympic Games.\n\nAdmission is free, and I had read on TripAdvisor that you could pay a couple Euros and actually run the track, but don't believe this is the norm, as I didn't see anyone around who actually worked for the stadium. It was just open to walk around a certain limited area.\n\nThere was more to the Olympic Park than just the stadium, so I explored a bit of that as well. The Palau Sant Jordi is a sporting and concert arena which during the '92 Olympics hosted the men's and women's gymnastics competitions, the men's and women's handball finals, the men's volleyball quarter- and semi-finals and finals and the women's volleyball semi-finals and finals.
