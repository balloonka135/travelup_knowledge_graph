There are several tests to be completed on cities or the word, movie productions, etc. The final objective is to figure out the secret combination to the lock which opens a wooden box provided to each two people sitting together, with either a whistle or a paper with instructions to scream at the end of the show inside. Definitely a very low budget production, with only three actors on stage and a very-low resolution screen where instructions for each quiz are given. Last, even if you have been handling the provided items all night, everything is to be returned at the end of the show (the wooden box, its lock and even a cheap pen provided), except for the whistle.

Everything is miked, the two opera singers (soprano and tenor) were downright horrible, and the operatic selections bore little or no relation to the flimsy story the show attempted to tell.  The three flamenco dancers - one female, two male - were impressive.  The musicians and other singers were okay, though the amplification seemed unnecessary.

If you're a first timer in Barcelona like we were, then a flamenco evening is a must and we thoroughly enjoyed ours at the Teatre Poliorama. We were given a good discount and, when we realized our view was obstructed by some burly men in front of us, the staff were so prompt in letting us move to the front at no extra charge before the show started. We thoroughly enjoyed the GranGala Flamenco. The opera had a Moroccan/Algerian music touch, the guitar was fabulous and the dancers, (especially the long-haired man) were simply exquisite. See any flamenco but do see one, and the Teatre Poliorama does not disappoint. \n\nTip: Use a proper DSLR camera without flash and without backlight LED (never a smartphone) to click pics in the interludes so you don't bother people around you.", "publishedDate": "2016-09-13", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 412380998, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244903-r412380998-Teatre_Poliorama-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This was a waste of precious time in my Barcelona visit.

The photograph on the booking site had set the dancers against a backdrop of the instantly recognisable glass ceiling of the Palau, but the performance for that night was in Teatre Poliorama, which is half the size and was half full.  Nevertheless, determined to enjoy the show and impressed by the first singers and dancers, we sat back and waited for the opera singers to do their thing.    \n\nMy first thought was \"Thank god we are not sitting under a glass roof\".  My second was \"Did he just sing a Puccini aria?\"  When I heard my daughter\u2019s stifled sniggers harmonising with a group of people sitting behind us, I knew that I was not alone.\n\nFrom here the audience was hauled along a nauseous roller coaster of heady Flamenco moments and the depths of embarrassing mismanaged warbling.  The Stage management, worse than a bad school nativity play, included highlights such as watching one of the dancers change behind a flimsy screen on stage, while another climbed up on a box and then climbed back down.  At one point it was clear that the second of the male dancers, whose day job must have eating too many Tapas, had forgotten that he was due back on.  As a consequence the excellent first dancer was forced to improvise a very obvious solo duo, while the singer repeated, albeit with a beautiful voice, \u00ab Yes, you can dance, keep on dancing \u2026 \u00bb  Then, after barely an hour, just when we thought that an interval and drink were due, they took a bow and offered an unasked for encore.  \n\nIn the interests of health and safety my daughter and I left before the encore aria, but outside on the pavement our laughter quickly transformed into anger.  Does playing to tourists give performers and their managers the right to abuse their intelligence, taste and hard-earned cash?  Does the fact that tourists are just passing through really mean that the quality of what they pay for is irrelevant?  Visitors are told to hang onto their bags and watch out for pickpockets, but nothing in their guidebook warns them about this kind of blatant theft.\n\nTo conclude, I am writing this review in the interests of anyone who might be thinking of spending 35 euros or more to see Opera y Flamenco.  Don\u2019t.  I suspect that the GranGala Flamenco, performed in the Palau de la Musica and including the best performers from Opera y Flamenco - but NOT the opera singers \u2013 will be at least 50% better.  If you are determined to hear and see Flamenco on a large stage, my advice is that you should go there, but anything that purports to blend opera with Flamenco in Barcelona, is to be avoided like the plague, or a mugger.", "publishedDate": "2016-04-03", "language": "en", "rating": 1}, {"id": 355060200, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d244903-r355060200-Teatre_Poliorama-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "A small theater on La Rambla, which is easy to find, and we really enjoyed our first experience of flamenco.
