The Palau is located  on Avinguda Diagonal.The modest size, but the outstanding  Palau Bar\u00f3 de Quadras is one of the jewels of Catalan modernism . The building is reminiscent of North-European palaces. The main facade is Gothic in its representation, referring to the Norman Gothic. The long, ornate balcony, with its busts of eminent medieval and Renaissance figures, floral motifs and heraldic shields, and the mansards on the upper floor, are really in keeping with the medieval European style. The gargoyles are particularly impressive. The interior of the palace hall deserves special attention.  The wide marble stairs are simply wonderful. The Palau opens to the public every Wednesday between 11 and 13h. Highly recommend.", "publishedDate": "2019-11-09", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 689548168, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2531489-r689548168-Palau_del_Baro_de_Quadras-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The museum is not free as some have mentioned, at least not when I was there nor according to their website.

So quite limited.\n\nAs for the museum, it a house museum, which was originally a private residence designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch in the Catalan Modernist architectural style, mixed with Gothic and Neo-Mudejar. The front fa\u00e7ade has an impressive fa\u00e7ade has impressive Gothic balconies, almost like a bay window covering the enter first floor level of the building.\n\nThe entrance to the building has demo-roofs typical of Neo-Mudejar buildings has does the upper part of the front. As you enter the building, the elaborate decorations of the stairway, mosaic walls and a glasswork on the skylight makes it instantly recognisable as Catalan Modernism as familiar to anyone who been inside Casa Mila or Casa Batllo.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you can accommodate the limited opening hours.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-14", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 675884819, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2531489-r675884819-Palau_del_Baro_de_Quadras-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Built in 1906, this handsome house is by Josep Puig i Cadafalch.
