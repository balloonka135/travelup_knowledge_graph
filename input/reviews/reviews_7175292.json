And unlike on Las Ramblas there are actually good options to wine and dine. For fantastic Tapas just head around the corner onto Carrer Mallorca and eat at the \"Cerveser\u00eda Catalana\".\n\nIt's funny how this street isn't busier. Many just stop walking once the reach Placa de Catalunya. But you really should keep walking. This street isn't very long anyways and can be done in little time. But definitely worth it.
