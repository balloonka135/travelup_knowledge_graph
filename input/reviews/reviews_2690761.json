That being said, we came by chance as we were strolling by the waters.  Took a walk around and found it very crowded with tourists (like myself) and found the stores to be mostly multinational chain stores that could be found anywhere else.

What a wonderful shopping experience. It was very busy with locals and tourists. Most people are dressed up and very fashionable.

Be sure to walk up and down Las Ramblas and visit the Maremagnum shopping mall.", "publishedDate": "2017-12-08", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
