Its a bit narrow so be aware if you dont like narrow spaces. \nThe column is 60 m high, and the other surprise is when you het out of the elevator its a bit more scary since you are in very narrow space with maximum 10 people and it can swing a bit if there is wind. I actually dont like hights but I was ok, but I saw some people a bit uncomfortable. But still I would recommend you do it. \nYou can be up as much as you like and then preds the button when you want to come down. The views are breathtaking.\nAfter it have a glass of wine for 2 euros (dicounted price for those with tickets, we even had it for 1 euro with coupons). The blond lady who works there is amazing - one of the best services in Barcelona. Thank you so much for the information, great service and feeling welcome. \nAlso there is an offical touristic shop (also 10 % discounts with bus cupons) with good offer. \nJust do it!

Then there's 4 buttresses that have medallions that depict persons related to Columbus.  Then we have 4 figures that represent the 4 realms of Spain-Catalonia, Leon, Aragon, and Castile.
