There were a guitar player, two singers and two flamenco dancers. It was my first flamenco show and I was very impressed. We all loved it! The skills, the passion!!!

I was very very amazed by how she controlled each and every piece of her body. Her performance was not only beautiful but convincing as well, it was like I was witnessing somebody's life. Overwhelmed in a great way, I even cried. Such a shame I didn't checked her name.. I loved the fiery passion of the male dancer too, every time he stomped on the stage floor I was like thunderstruck! And the singer, his voice! The guitarist! Everything, EVERYTHING AT ALL was absobloodylutely FANTASTIC! The venue was also swanky and lovely. I literally loved every second. A part of me wanted to take photos but another part of me was really glad they didn't allow us to, because I could solely focus on the performance.

The guitarist was very good also having a couple of occasions during the performance to show how well he can play. Again not going to claim I am an expert so no opinion but the third guy had a box with some instrument inside that he played by striking it. Also a lot of the music was made up of simply clapping and tapping feet not really a \u00a325 price tag. \nFor short times during the performance 2 dancers in turn would take to the stage. I did really enjoy the parts when they really gave it everything they had, however this would genuinely only last about 3 seconds per time and happened rarely with the rest of the time having them tapping around the stage at a much slower pace. \nIt was a 1hr show which included a 10 minute interval. I believe the interval was mostly for the singer given how much he was putting into it but at a 1hr run time including the interval could the other 2 musicians and the dancers filled in this time without halting the show?\nIt sounds harsh but I genuinely fell asleep during a long period of the 3 guys playing their instruments and clapping on their own with no dancing their was just not enough going on to grab my attention as all three were just sat down. \nThe building was very nice and the choice of drink included within the price was literally anything at the bar. \nI believe it was very traditional flamenco without the hype created over the years so they certainly deserve respect for sticking to their roots but honestly it\u2019s not worth the price. \nAlmost pains me to say it as I am sure it takes a lot of skill and years of development but save yourself \u00a325 and an hour of your time by watching a street performer instead or go to a cheaper show. \nI know this review sounds harsh and due to the skill level of the performers I would not give a 1 star review but this is my honest opinion with the bottom line being it is just too expensive for what it is.
