There were no plans in the normal architecural sense and Gaudi aceived this with his personal invovlement on a daily basis.  A lot of the features he personally designed and cast like the door handles upwards. You need to allow at least 2 hours or preferable half a day to take in all the detailed features.

On this road, you can see the magnificent Casa Amatller, Casa Bonet, Casa Mulleras, Casa Lle\u00f3 i Morera and Casa Batll\u00f3.\n\nMost people will only know about Casa Batllo and reasonably so for it\u2019s fame, but don\u2019t know about the other fine examples of Catalan Modernism right next to it. So do keep your eyes open.\n\nIronically, it's easier to see all the houses on Manzana de la Discordia during winter because the trees laden leaves of the summer prevents you from getting a clear view from across the street.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-14", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 686843805, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d528113-r686843805-Manzana_de_la_Discordia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Pickpocketed the other day right in front.

It's as if Barcelona's most important Modernista architects agreed to have a competition to see who would impress the most. Architects with wildly different styles, have produced some stunning results. The buildings clash with each other and with those next to them and just about everywhere else. Hard to choose!
