The beautiful basilica dominates the centre of the square. Markets are held here at certain times. We enjoyed sitting out under the patio heaters, having a drink and people watching, while listening to the street entertainers. This square is in the Gothic quarter, not far from Las Ramblas. It's very atmospheric & better value than the bars on Las Ramblas.
