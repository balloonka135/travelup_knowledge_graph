The fountain is part of the walls back in the day when Barcelona was a walled city. Porta Ferrissa can be translated as Iron Gate. It\u2019s name coming from the iron bars that once decorated the gate.\n\nThe ceramics tiles that decorated with ceramics were only added in 1957 and made for the occasion of the Mare de D\u00e9u de la Merc\u00e8 festival. The mural reflects an everyday scene of 18th century Barcelona, with scenes of people strolling in front of a Porta Ferrissa, full of commercial activity and an image of Saint Josep Oriol. The central part of the fountain, is some text written with a  historical account of the fountain.\n\nThe tile decorates are nice and worth a detour if you\u2019re in this part of La Rambla, but don\u2019t go out of the way to see it though.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-16", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 611610190, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10538454-r611610190-Fuente_de_la_Portaferrissa-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I recently visited Barcelona, and while walking around the side streets took a photo of this amazing mosaic, made from tiny pieces.  When I returned home, and did a little research, I found out it depicts one of the old gates to the City, and a scene of how life was.  It's a lovely piece of local art/history to look at, providing nice photo opportunity.
