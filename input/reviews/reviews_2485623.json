The film resells the romantic legend as you walk through different rooms which close behind you as you watch the next section of film. Our daughter really enjoyed the film but for the adults it was just ok, interesting to hear the story and inspiration but the film was too long and drawn out (some questionable acting). Probably 20 minutes in total as you move through the rooms). It felt like an attempt to offer something completely different to the tours in Barcelona and it was a good start, you then go to the rooftop and can look inside some of the towers the audio guide will tell you about the history of the architect and his role in Barcelona. The mini guides and projections are interesting, for kids (and adults) there is a touch and feel display with different objects from the buildings exterior.

The museum doesn't attempt to give you an idea of what the inside of the house would have been like and that feels like a missed opportunity which could really enhance the visit.

La Casa de les Punxes (House of Spikes) - so-called for its six pointy towers - has always been one of Barcelona's most eye-catching sights - a veritable fairytale castle just five minutes' walk from Passeig de Gracia - and now you can go up on the roof and up inside the main Spike.\nYou can also opt for an entertaining audio-visual depiction of the St. George and the dragon legend (this legend of Catalonia's patron saint is a recurring theme throughout the house).\nThis is not a museum as such, so don't expect to see rooms full of period furniture - but for anyone with an interest in Catalan Modernisme, the visit is a fascinating and highly informative experience.", "publishedDate": "2016-08-16", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 405576011, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2485623-r405576011-Casa_de_les_Punxes-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Nice guides take you around the house in the street explaining the history and decoration of the building. \nSelf-guided tour with audio-guide to the towers and final video sequences about St Jordi legend completes a pleasant visit up to 2:30h if you stop by all infos and interactive contents.", "publishedDate": "2016-08-15", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 358233478, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2485623-r358233478-Casa_de_les_Punxes-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Casa de les Punxes is a beautiful private building at Avenida Diagonal with splendid towers and architecture.
