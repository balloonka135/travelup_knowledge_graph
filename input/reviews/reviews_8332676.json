Andrea washes, cut and styled my hair (which was an absolute rats nest after poorly done coloring in the states and traveling for weeks), with amazing results! He followed that with a nice close shave for my husband, all for just under 90 Euros. I felt pampered and Andreas advice on how best to cut the damaged hair without losing much length was perfect. \nThe salon itself has a great vibe, with the original artwork and light refreshments (the coconut macaroons were light and fresh). Overall, a terrific way to freshen up and feel cultured all at once.

Very good communication and fast 10 point for that.. I arrived and the space looks great fancy nice design.. It talks to your eyes. Person who cut my hair was nice too and indeed they cut very nice especially I have a short hair and not easy to find a good hairdresser. The problem was when I came to casa and pay. On website it mention cut 30 euro 19 euro blow-dry 5 euro stylish advise. All perfect however they charge me all. No any customer like surprises.. First of all blowdry should be stylish dry if u just dry my hair u can not charge me 19 euro if u cut for 30 euro. also styling hair 5 euro. Hmm I just show u picture and u kind of agreed or give your openion and this cost u 5 euro.. Happy that conversation was fast because other wise I could not imagine the charge. I pointed out and indeed the person was fast and instead of 19euro  he charged for wash 10 euro only and I did not mention the 5 euro.. I was like ok no big deal. A little advise if u wanna charge stylish advise than u have to do more than u did than u can charge whatever u want but if u do a normal conversation to decide how to cut is a routine conversation at hairdresser and u can not show on website the price choosble but than it looks like mandatiry service. I advise inform directly cut-wash-dry 50 euro and change the concept  styling advise 5 euor or do the stylish job. Because u atrack people Pero u will not keep them.. Pricing need to be clear. And it's ugly to adding up many amounts after. Will I come yes I will because again I think they cut nice and will try color too. It's need to be same feeling with pricing list.

First, it is very easy getting there, as it is right off a main road (I took the bus there from Rambla and it took 15 minutes). Second, the space is gorgeous. You walk in to an impressive hall with artwork on the walls and into a space with three salon chairs placed in a non-traditional way. There is exposed brick that is charming and very Barcelona. And the staff. They greet you with warm and friendly smiles and ask upon arrival if you would like something to drink (water, coffee, coke). Julia is great, not only because she\u2019s very good at hair, but she\u2019s an English speaking hairstylist who is really good in Barcelona! I got a trim and wanted to keep my length. Although I have some thin and somewhat (ok, very) damaged hair from my use of the curling iron, she listened to my request of cutting as little as possible and delivered a beautiful cut. It\u2019s healthy and bouncy and she styled it very well too. 5 stars.
