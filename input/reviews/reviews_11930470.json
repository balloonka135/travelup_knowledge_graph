Unfortunately they changed the travel plans and we didn't get the notice, making us all late.  As a result, our time at Montserrat was shorter than it would have been.  We didn't have time to see the Black Madonna or cable car, funicular.  But what we did see, which included the Boy's Choir, was well worth the trip.  The vista is beautifully inspiring.  It IS a trip worth going to if you have a half-day. Our trip could have been better with better planning of guide.", "publishedDate": "2019-11-14", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 719494813, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d11930470-r719494813-Montserrat-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I join a local tour, half day.  we 1st took the train and go up to the mountain.  once we arrive, the view of the Mountain, i have no word to describe.

It's a great place to get away from the crowd and meditate. We used a tram to go to the monastery-there you can see the famous Black Madonna and the Choir boys. There is also a restaurant near the tram station but there arent many options to choose from. Highly recommend to bring own food and drinks! And please wear comfortable shoes, warm and water resistant clothing if possible. There's lot of walking and it was windy and cold on a gloomy day.\n\nWe took a funicular to go to the top of the mountain. You could also hike up top if you dont want to spend another 15 \u20ac or so. We hiked up the path on the right and saw the breathtaking view. After all that, we hiked back down to the monastery, took us 30 mins.", "publishedDate": "2019-10-16", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 716873164, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d11930470-r716873164-Montserrat-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We had a day tour with Ordonez and went to 3 places this being the first.

Walk around the edges of the property where it is quieter, and you will feel the beauty of this spot.\nUnfortunately, even the cathedral, where the black Madonna resides, is crowded and thus is not very quiet - still worth a visit, however.\nTip: As said, there are huge crowds, so go as early in the morning as you can. It seems that the crowds arrive around noon.\nTip: If you need a sandwich for lunch, go all the way back to the last restaurant on the left, near the statue of the bishop, where they will make your sandwich to order while you wait.\nBetter than the pre-made sandwiches in the gift shops. \nTip: Don't overlook the food stalls for some nifty snacks. I bought several huge fresh figs to serve as desert and they were delicious.\nRegrettably, we were not able to hear the boys choir, as it was their day off. They usually perform around noon-1PM daily.\nThis site takes some time to reach from Barcelona - about three hours total travel time - so plan to spend at least a half day for your visit.\nIt's worth it.", "publishedDate": "2019-09-23", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 708278102, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d11930470-r708278102-Montserrat-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Very impressive monastery built into the side of a mountain about an hour train ride from Barcelona.

So I find it strange that so many reviewers talk about Montserrat the mountain, which is not in Barcelona at all, but a very long way away! The Montserrat, Placa de Catalunya, is a bronze sculpture facing the north side (of the plaza) on a column on the east side of the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya. It was made by Eusebio Arnau in 1928, to pay tribute to the famous Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey, which is in the mountain of the same name (Montserrat), outside Barcelona. The sculpture is that of a partly clothed, bearded, old man, holding  a small statue of the Virgin of Montserrat. It is worth having a look if you are in the Plaza. The plaza is a busy place, full of visitors. It is quite beautiful and is adorned with two lovely fountains, and numerous sculptures, as well as other items.", "publishedDate": "2019-05-25", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 673523664, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d11930470-r673523664-Montserrat-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Well worth visiting but the half day trip to Montserrat doesn't provide enough time to fully explore this site.
