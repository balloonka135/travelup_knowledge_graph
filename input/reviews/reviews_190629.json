Colors and natural, round shapes adorn the interior of the building and the courtyards. At the beginning of the descent from the roof, the interior is reminiscent of a whale belly.\n\"La Pedrera\" (\"The Quarry\") - most of the people who mocked the building at the time would probably change their minds today. That is the passage of time. Much of what is art was not considered to be art at the time. The building was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984 as the first building of the 20th century. I think that says a lot about it.\n\nOf course, the building does not come close to the Familia Sagrada, but it is still worth seeing.\nAn outstanding architect and artist - and to my knowledge that should have been Gaudi's last work.\n\nThere are also long lines of people here, like most of the other sights, and waiting is no fun.

The rooftop trip is amazing, full of the most surreal shapes and flowing lines inspired by nature and the elements of water, earth, wind etc. What an incredibly fantastical futuristic imagination Gaudi must have had. We were so lucky with the weather as the blue skies gave the shapes a truly stunning backdrop. One of my group has a real fear of heights but was able to walk the rooftop and marvel at the place as the roof is enclosed by a waist height rolling wall around the perimeter which helped them feel safe. \nAfter coming in from the roof you enter the attic space, also magical in the way it is structured and you can learn more about how Gaudi created the building. Finally you drop down a further floor and enter the apartment, left as it would have been at the turn of the 1900's when it was first built. Some beautiful exhibits and tactile features such as the architraves and the folding connecting door between the dining room and lounge. \nHighly recommended v\u00ecsit, a must see site in Barcelona even if only there for a short time.

It is being classified as one of his most quintessential works ever! What makes Casa Mil\u00e0 special is it pays attention to every detail of Gaudi's genius organic sensitivities of modernista architecture, which all created and converted into his vision of the domestic world. For me, the highlights of La Pedrera are:\n1) Facade: Which I think is the most attractive part of Casa\u00a0Mil\u00e0 and it's hard not to be attracted by its exterior curved walls and balconies.\n2) Roof Terrace: This rooftop is filled with curved sculptures and chimneys. Unfortunately, it was shut on the day we visited due to the drizzle.\n3) La Pedrera apartment: The apartments show what the lives of the typical affluence of Barcelona in the late 19th-century were like.\u00a0\n4) Staircase & courtyard: 2 words: Posh and Grand.\n5) Interior courtyard: A courtyard decorated with mosaics and multicoloured wall paintings.\n6) Espai Gaudi: This is my other favourite part of Casa Mila as I liked the cured supporting ceiling joists, interiors and its mini-museum!\nUnfortunately, we didn't have a good time at the Casa Mila due to:\n1) Staffs: All staffs we came across were rude - from the receptionist in the ticket office to the guy who escorted us to the lift. They were just unbelievably rude!\n2) Roof Terrace: Unfortunately, it was closed on the day we visited due to the light rain. We were told the roof terrace was closed shortly AFTER we brought the ticket. (When I tried to ask the staff why she didn't tell me before I paid, she pointed to a small note at the door and to the almost invisible small print on the ticket saying the terrace would be closed on the rainy day. She either allow us to come back at another time or to give us a refund.)\u00a0\n3) Didn't like the apartment: To be honest, the apartment-style and the interior design were not our cups of tea. We prefered\u00a0Casa Batll\u00f3 much more than Casa Mil\u00e0!\u00a0\nTips:\u00a0\ni) It's 3 Euro cheaper per ticket if you booked online, you can book it on your mobile upon arrival if you're unsure what time you'd arrived.\u00a0\nii) Rainy days: Try not to visit on the rainy days as the roof terrace would be closed.", "publishedDate": "2020-02-15", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 745217176, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d190629-r745217176-Casa_Mila_La_Pedrera-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "It's an amazing building as expected, entertaining stories and details.

Without it, there'd be only a few inches of lip between you and a tumble into the interior courtyards.\"\n\nWell, happened to me. Not quite a tumble into the interior courtyards, but after someone else beside me tripped and someone else tried to help, I was pulled into the jostle, and was knocked headlong unto the steps below.\n\nIt wasn't just bad luck. The uneven design of the steps, the lack of sufficient lighting, the lack of handholds, the lack of assistance to first-time visitors, the lack of signage or warning/caution markers, etc., I am certain all contributed to the fall. There were also a lot of people and we were not sufficiently warned about the hazard of negotiating the uneven steps. I firmly believe that had the hazards been managed better, I might have better recovered my balance and not have fallen in the first place. But, alas...did.\n\nI managed to take the brunt of the fall on my arms but still hit my face on the steps. My chin split and I ended up needing 3 stitches. It's already been a week and my face is still slightly puffy and have not recovered full mobility in in my left arm. In the beginning, even the simple tasks of eating, drinking, and brushing teeth was difficult. What a way to ruin a holiday, right?\n\nOn one hand...the staff of La Pedrera were quick to respond and the tour guide did initially attend to me. However, after I was administered first aid, I was put in a cab with a scribbled address to a hospital and was pretty much left to fend for myself. And yes...I even had to pay for the taxi fare. I do resent that I was not accompanied or met at the hospital. For the most part, no one in the hospital could speak English and could not explain my condition to me clearly, which added to my distress.\u00a0\n\nI have since written La Pedrera at the supplied email address but so far, no response.\n\nWell...at least they refunded my ticket. \n\nI would still recommend the visit to La Pedrera-Casa Mila and if I get a chance to go back to Barcelona, may visit again.
