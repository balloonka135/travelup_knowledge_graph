To clarify, there is a park called \"Parc de la Ciutadella\" and within that park are several monuments, statues, a very large lake and a stand out fountain which is NOT called El Desconsol despite so many people reviewing it here!  That fountain is called Cascada Monument.\n\nWithin the park is also the parliament building and in front of that is the pond with the actual sculpture called El Desconsol.  It is hauntingly beautiful (see pic) and translates to \"I Despair\" with a female kneeling in a physically deflated position, her face covered by her hair and feeling so sad she cannot be consoled.  Despite this sadness, it is strangely a popular area for romantics who bring their partners to sit on the benches surrounding the pond, enjoying the beauty while holding hands and kissing.", "publishedDate": "2018-03-02", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 558649058, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d240504-r558649058-Desconsol-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This is a beautiful replica of a famous sculpture, located in the middle of a pond in a tranquil area of the park.\nThe figure is both provocative and innocent at the same time, which makes for a gorgeous photo-op.", "publishedDate": "2018-02-05", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 475769706, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d240504-r475769706-Desconsol-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Visited in April with my friends.
