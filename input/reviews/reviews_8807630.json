The building is fine example of Modernism with influences from Neo-Mudejar, especially with the use of demo-roofs on the upper floors. The exterior has so many stunning features such as bright red floral motifs on the facade of the building common to many other works of Modernism. The most outstanding features I think are balconies designed with a floor in the style of 4 semi-pointed arched, and the bay windows that protrude from the facade across the entire vertical face of the building.\n\nSadly, Casa Llopis Bofill is a priviate residence building and I had to be content with admiring it from the outside. It\u2019s still worth a detour if you love Catalan Modernism.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-13", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
