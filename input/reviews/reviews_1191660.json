A wide choice of Catalan cuisine, beautifully cooked and presented, we thoroughly enjoyed all of our dishes; a year ago we had the taster menu, that was excellent, this time we went a la carte, also a stunning collection of delicate flavours, really worthwhile.\n\nThe cost: Ok, now this is the bit the could be a deal breaker for some, this place is not cheap, but I believe in you getting what you pay for, a dinner for two with wine etc will cost in excess of 100 euros but I feel that the quality of food, service and the evening as a whole warrants the price tag, a good example was the 14 euros I payed for a Larios brandy, this is expensive, there were much cheaper options but I chose this because I know it is a fantastic brandy, the bonus was the portion size, it was huge, way larger than anything I have seen our trip so I suppose it wasn't so costly after all!\n\nWould we go again? absolutely, If you like dinner to be a whole evening affair with fine food, well chosen wine, great service... somewhere where you spend an entire evening then Casa Calvet is well worth a look.", "publishedDate": "2015-04-10", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 263530342, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1191660-r263530342-Casa_Calvet-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This restaurant is fine dining in a house designed by Gaudi.

After a fine meal, just on time, the waiter discreetly approached our table with a wonderful desert (apple tartine) with candles on it. It was a nice surprise for the person.\nBesides the food and service, ambiance is also unique, because of the modernista architecture.

It\u00b4s a great experience not to be missed.", "publishedDate": "2010-07-20", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
