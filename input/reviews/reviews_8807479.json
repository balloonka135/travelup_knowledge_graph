Even when you try to avoid usual tourist routes, chances are you will stumble on something unexpected but exceptional. This is the case with this building designed by Lluis Domenech i Montaner in 1902. A beautiful ornate facade and amazing balconies are only few of the distinguished characteristics of this amazing modernist house.", "publishedDate": "2016-01-24", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
