It was very hot and sunny on that day but thankfully, the management\u00a0provided free beach umbrellas\u00a0for people in the queue. The queue was split into half, 1/2 was on the ground floor and the other 1/2 was on the upper deck. People have to queue for tickets on the ground floor before taking the lift to the upper deck to queue again for the cable car.\nThe queuing experience was painful and exhausting. But once I boarded the cable car, the amazing view had made me forgotten all stresses\u00a0that I had for the past 2 hours. We were lucky to get in the front row inside the cable car as it provided the best \"270-angle\" view. The ride started at \"Torre\u00a0Sam Senastoa\" (The south tip of the beach)\u00a0and it finished at \"Torre de Miramar\" (The Montjuic Hill) and the whole journey took about 15 minutes. The scenery along the Port Vell coastline was absolutely breathtaking, i.e. blue sky and blue sea... and it was one of the best moments I had in Barcelona. It's highly recommended for anyone who fancies taking a look at the coastline of Barcelona and who doesn't mind queuing for 2 hours.\np.s. The tickets prices listed in front of the ticket booth were misleading - a single ticket actually cost only 11.00 Euro.", "publishedDate": "2020-04-25", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 743023696, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2328556-r743023696-Teleferico_del_Puerto-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We got the tTleferico del Puerto only one way and walked to Montjuic Castle from there.

I have read other reviews and it seems everyone waiting to get the telef\u00e9rico from the port area had to wait long lines.  I took it from the Hotel Miramar stop and I did not have to wait.  However I would suggest that if you take it from Hotel Miramar that you start your day on that side of town and end up at the port.  We did Plaza Espa\u00f1a, The Barcelona Museum and all the other land marks around and walked to the teleferico.  Please notice that before you get to the Hotel Miramar there is another teleferic so unless you want to do that route keep walking.
