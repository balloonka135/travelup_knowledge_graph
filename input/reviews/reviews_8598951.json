There is a nice view over the city though, but the castle itself didn\u2019t have much to offer. If you don\u2019t mind to spend an hour to get there for a nice view- you should go. For me- I\u2019d prefer to see the city with gorgeous art nouveau building.

Well worth the visit.\n\nUnfortunately the very well situated, and nicely presented restaurant is a disappointment.  The staff were rude and disinterested - the scruffy, dog eared and dirty menus were thrown (accurately it has to be said) on to our table as the waiter walked past, and then we had to wait another 15 minutes before he bothered to return.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t busy.

The view from the park of Barcelona city and the Barcelona Port was brilliant! Clear views and it was such a peaceful park barely anybody (i.e. tourists) but locals who were walking their dogs or jogging through. \n\nIt is great for a short photo stop and there IS one hotel there, i.e. Miramar Hotel. There is also a cafe there though we didn't try it. \n\nYou can probably take a taxi up there or walk from somewhere from the Barcelona Port area if you are not taking the bus.", "publishedDate": "2018-04-07", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 570954267, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8598951-r570954267-Mirador_del_Poble_Sec-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "You can walk up to this park and viewpoint from the Marina.
