Big park; not as many people as I expected to find during the month of August (Friday day of the week) . Although I enjoyed it. \nTo me it lacks the charm I get when I visit the Disney Parks, but that\u2019s me \uf04a\nPlenty of food and drink and spaces to sit down and relax.", "publishedDate": "2019-09-04", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 652056170, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8677305-r652056170-Aventura_Park_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We stayed at one of the local hotels - full board - and got a pass that let us thru to the park and its attractions without having to queue up. It's a fun place for people - and kids - of all ages. The attractions are superb - do not try the kamikaze ones though if you are not a jet pilot :) The shows were very good, too. We spent two full days there enjoying its various world zones, the atmosphere, and the sunny weather. Definitely a must if you visit Catalunya in summer!", "publishedDate": "2019-02-13", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 533071111, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8677305-r533071111-Aventura_Park_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Going to Barcelona?

It is about 9 euro to get in but you can play until close. My almost 2 year old loves it there. The staff will happily join in, play and save her when she gets stuck in the ball pit. There are different areas for different age ranges. Parents are allowed in 1 part for the infants. Don't forget to bring socks. If you forget they do sell them for your little ones. Well worth the stop if you need to get the little ones good and tired so you can go explore.", "publishedDate": "2016-09-11", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 366226444, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8677305-r366226444-Aventura_Park_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Great for a hot day as multiple of the rides involve water. Only bad point was the lines were too long. 2 hrs was the longest I had to wait  for a 1 minute roller coaster, which is crazy. Overall it was loads of fun and the rides I went on were really cool.
