Something was calling me to come into it. So after Park Guel we walk in and realize that this church was for saint Joseph and Jesus. At this particular part of my life this was very needed to have a church dedicated to Joseph and his son as my dad had cancer. There was a beautiful statue of Joseph holding Jesus. We walked into the chapel and I stopped and said a prayer for my dad. We walked into the gift shop and I was about to buy a small wearable prayer card. I asked the nun if she could say a prayer for my dad and bless it and she did. Then she gave it to me for free. It brought me to tears. My dad ended up wearing it every day and was cremated with it. It was a shinning light in a dark time and I personally think the nuns prayer helped carry him a little longer.

It really is something to see. As far as we could tell it was not open to the public because if it is as impressive on the inside as it is on the outside then it must be something to see. Given all the walking that we had just done in Park Guell it was nice to sit down and have a rest in such pleasant surroundings.", "publishedDate": "2016-04-29", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 330500786, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8422039-r330500786-Real_Santuario_San_Jose_de_la_Montana-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "On the way to Guell Park we stumbled upon this building. Unfortunately it was not open saw we didn't get to see the interior. The outside patterning of the stone is striking and gorgeous. It is like someone put animal print onto the stone.
