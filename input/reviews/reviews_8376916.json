The park has its own listing on TA and that's where most of these reviews for the park itself should be relocated.\n\nAnyway, the sporting venue is like a surprise when you're walking through the park.  It is located nearest to the zoo area of the park and stands out like a wooden lattice in the distance.  We saw all these people gathered around huge windows of the building under the wooden lattice, some were shouting or yelling out supportive \"Come on\" or \"Yes!\".  Our interest was peaked so we walked over and this turned out to be an indoor sports centre, which was at that time hosting a basketball game.  \n\nThe sports centre is maintained very well, providing important sports encouragement to the local community of children and youths.  They played a really good game too, considering they were older teens/not quite adults. It was impressive that the facility is actually underground and the huge floor to ceiling windows on the ground floor of the park, they provide free viewing for the community and lots of natural light without causing distraction to the players.  Clever build all around.", "publishedDate": "2018-03-08", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 524180060, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8376916-r524180060-Parc_de_la_Ciutadella_Centre_Esportiu_Municipal-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We stumbled on this wonderful park and my lovely wife said, \" Let's row.\" So we did. 6 Euros for a 1/2 hour and we had an absolute blast.
