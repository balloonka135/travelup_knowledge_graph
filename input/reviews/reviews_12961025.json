The owner - Caterina was very helpful and responsive. I ended up buying this piece later when I was back to US. Caterina was very helpful and the whole experience was such a pleasure! I love Barcelona and now have a piece of it in my home. Thank you, Caterina and please say my regards to your father, Bruno Pedrosa.", "publishedDate": "2018-09-29", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 532794108, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d12961025-r532794108-Mulas_y_Pedrosa_Art_Gallery-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Went there the second day after apparently it opened and was blown away.\nTo find such a little gem selling beautiful pieces of art is rare, the selection was eclectic and they have pieces from artist of several countries.\nWas hard leaving the shop resisting the urge of buying every single item. \nIf you happen to be in Barcelona is definitely worth the visit.", "publishedDate": "2017-10-14", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 532155264, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d12961025-r532155264-Mulas_y_Pedrosa_Art_Gallery-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The two owners are gentle and art connoisseur.
