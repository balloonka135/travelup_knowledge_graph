If you are a re-enactor, a cosplayer, or just interested in clothing, this is a must-see. There were also a number of designs from recent fashion by Spanish design great Balenciaga.

My first visit to the MDD was in June 2017 to see the David Bowie Is exhibition, as I did not have the opportunity to view it at the Victoria and Albert (V&A) Museum in London. When I went to Pink Floyd\u2019s exhibition: Their Mortal Remains at the V&A, its severe space challenges resulted in a suboptimal experience. The MDD did not suffer from these logistical issues and the larger rooms allowed the objects on display to breathe with singular vitality. The MDD enabled the dynamic impact of Bowie\u2019s creative oeuvre to transport one into a whole new visual dimension.\n\nEven if there is not an exhibition on that you particularly want to see, I thoroughly recommend indulging time on the MDD, if you have an abiding interest in the applied arts.\n", "publishedDate": "2018-08-26", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 607718585, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4722328-r607718585-Museu_del_Disseny_de_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Didn't realize when we went, but It was free on Sunday.

Entering into the exhibit we were greeted with a friendly girl who gave us all the information we needed and our headsets, which really made the exhibit what it was, as the headsets automatically voiced what you were looking at as you wandered around. Which was particularly good while watching the interviews and music videos set around the displays.\n\nThe exhibit was full of David Bowie facts, at least one if not more of his outfits from each era, handwritten lyrics, and tons more information about the legend himself. The best part by a mile was the end of the exhibit named 'David Bowie IS all around you'. I won't give too much away, but all I will say is that this is the moment it became a highlight of my life. Booming music, with archived video footage and Bowie artifacts around the huge room made it an experience of a lifetime. Something which I will never forget and will continue to tell people about and encourage them to go and see for themselves.\n\nIf you are a David Bowie fan then you need to go and see this, if you are not you still need to go and see this.

When we were there the floors contained:\n1. A collection of illustrated advertising, going back to the 1920's (I think) up to the 1980's. I can't remember if it had English explanations on there, but the Spanish ones were really interesting.\n2. A wonderful exhibit of clothing going back to the 1530's till modern times. Each had a detailed explanation of what the silhouette was trying to achieve, so that was very informative and again interesting to look at trends throughout the times.\n3. A collection of miscellaneous artifacts from Barcelona: fabrics, household items, and it even housed the oldest surviving chariot (Cinderella style, it was just beautiful).\n4. An exhibit about Barcelona designers and how they impacted the world. If you're not familiar with the history of design, some of the items might really surprise you.\n\nMost of the other visitors we saw just skimmed through and were done really fast, but we thought that reading and looking through everything closely was just such a learning experience, we would've spent a lot more time there if we could afford it.
