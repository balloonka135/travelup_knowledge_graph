We popped into a supermarket to get some snacks and drinks but there are many people walking up and down the beach who will sell you a can of drink for \u20ac2 if you can\u2019t be bothered to go back! We got 2 sun beds and an umbrella for \u20ac45, a single bed and umbrella was \u20ac30. We spent all day there so felt we got value for money.
