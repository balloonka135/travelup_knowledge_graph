It was Easter weekend and myriad visitors were taking photos in the square. I immediately thought that the area likely displayed a similar look centuries ago when it was a Roman forum. The shape is typical for that period; the public often gathers here; and two important political buildings face each other. The name, however, comes from a Medieval church that once dominated the area. It was demolished to build the City Hall and the Palau de la Generalitat in the 15th century, and both structures have undergo changes throughout the years.\n\nWe first went to look at the City Hall on the south. It features a nice neoclassical facade. Then we crossed the pedestrians-only square (at least for that afternoon) to the Palau de la Generalitat on the north. That building, which is the seat of Catalonia's regional government, has a late-Renaissance style with neoclassical elements. \n\nThe square would have been more interesting for me if we had been able to enter these buildings.

I recommend that you access the plaza off of Las Ramblas and enter through Carrer de Ferran. Ferran will eventually open into the Plaza de Sant Jaume, where two government buildings face each other. This is the site of the medieval government center, as well as the ancient Roman heart of the city. There is an official tourist office in the ground floor of one of these massive buildings, the Ajuntament of Barcelona\u2014in case you need help or a map, or maybe take a walking tour here. If you continue past the plaza, the Carrer de Ferran turns into Carrer Jaume and then it is called Carrer de la Princessa, which leads you to the Picasso museum\u2014if that is your interest. Otherwise, I would recommend using the Plaza de Sant Jaume as your reference point in navigating the gothic streets in that area (left of the plaza if you entered via Ramblas and Ferran). Look for the beautiful gothic bridge between two buildings off of the plaza and that street (Carrer Bisbe) will take you to the Barcelona cathedral. If you want to meander prior to going to the cathedral, you might take the street right of the bridge street. The street is Carrer de Paradis but possibly no street name will be visible, so just choose the street right of the bridge street. Before you enter the street, you will see that it is short before bending right. Take the street, bend right, and straight ahead of you will be a building, in which is the Temple of Augustus\u2014again, this area reaches back into the ancient Roman settlement in Barcelona. The temple is free but well-maintained, so don\u2019t be afraid to enter it even if it\u2019s a little neglected by the main tourist crowd that tends to take Carrer Bisbe instead of this tiny neighboring side street. If you want some good shopping after visiting the temple and/or cathedral, return to Plaza de Sant Jaume and head down Carrer Sant Honorat (which is the street left of the bridge street). Take Carrer Sant Honora to its very end, where it meets Carrer Sant Sever. My favorite shop is there, to the left, I believe\u2014the Basilica Galeria, which is a jewelry-lovers haven with a big range of prices!

It was around lunchtime, and we found a number of restaurants with tables outdoors, sheltered from the sun, and with food at reasonable prices. It was a Saturday, and the placa was hosting an art market, which operated until afternoon siesta time. In addition, a couple of buskers were entertaining with a rendition of the tango.
