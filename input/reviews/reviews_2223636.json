Happily, MEAM was a surprising antidote to all that flotsam. Here, exciting and emotive figurative art holds sway!  \n\nWhile the museum's building (a former villa) was interesting in and of itself, its permanent and temporary exhibits of contemporary figurative art drew me in. The temporary exhibit (sadly, however, finished as of 1 December) of works by Pedro del Toro, a brilliant and accomplished contemporary Spanish artist, was just as riveting as some of El Greco's and Rubens's priceless figurative paintings that I later admired in the Prado Museum. I trust that MEAM will continue to offer shows of similarly high quality in the future, and that modern European painters will continue to excite!", "publishedDate": "2019-12-05", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 726944668, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2223636-r726944668-MEAM_Museu_Europeu_d_Art_Modern-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "The museum has a small but interesting permanent collection (1 floor) plus another 1-and-a-bit floors of temporary space \u2014 maybe worth an hour to visit.

Some of the hyper-realism paintings are great but most are very very dull indeed, sometimes bordering on kitsch.

I'm a classical musician by trade and whilst I like a bit of minimalism, with no context or information of what was playing, it all sounded a bit 'beige' and added nothing to the enjoyment of the art.

One of the major guidebooks (Rough Guide?) mentioned this one in its coverage of the barrio, almost as an afterthought. \n\nI wanted to visit as it shows modern figurative art only - that is, no abstracts and no old tellies and other stuff that should have gone straight to the tip. \n\nWalking to it, I was struggling to call to mind any other modern collection which excludes such works, managing only KogArt in Budapest (and there may have been a few abstracts there). \n\nI visited on a Friday morning in May, fighting my way past the hordes trying to get into the Picasso museum, a few steps further along the street to MEAM.\n\nIt must be pretty heartbreaking for the staff. While I was picking up a guide book, 3 or 4 people came in to ask where the PM was. Those people who did ask about MEAM itself seemed to be deterred by an admission fee the equivalent of 2 or 3 cups of coffee in St****cks. A real shame.\n\nMost kinds of figurative art are here but, principally, were are literally looking at oil or acrylic on canvas with a strong minority sculpture offering. \n\nOne floor was devoted to a special exhibition on a Catalan sculptor ( Josep Clara) but the permanent collection floor is the star of the show.\n\nWithout exception (and I wouldn't say that about many places) pieces here show talent in thought and execution, sometimes humour, sometimes other emotions. Some refer back to other painters (Ingres for nudes say) or to biblical or classical subjects.\n\nThere are portraits and self-portraits in different styles. Nudes are of a similar proprotion to more general exhibitions but landscape or cityscape do not figure to any great degree (although the one or two there are very good). Some of the sculpure is remarkable.\n\nOne needs to put away preconception of figurative art (and its subjects) as something that only happened in the past. And we are unused to modern paintings of contemporary situations (girls taking selfies or motor cars), so some of the subjects come as a shock. This says more about the policies of art galleries, and probably us, than the quality of paintings.\n\nPaintings such as Dresden (1990) by Marti Teixador, Vaticano IV (2014) by Josep Anaya, S/T (2013) by Carlos Marijuan (2013) or the modern interpretation of the Temptation of St Anthony by Jorge Villalba (2008) would be worth a pitch in any national collection.\n\nAnyway, if you can cope with two visits to galleries in Barcelona, go to this one (and MNAC, obviously). You can see equally good - or better - Picasso collections in lots of places.\n\nGo on, give it a try. You'll enjoy it. You won't get jostled here, either.\n\nTo the gallery - well done! and keep trying.
