This building  has been designed by Catalan architect architect Salvador Valeri i Pupurull. It has two distinct fa\u00e7ades. The main fa\u00e7ade, which overlooks Barcelona's Avinguda Diagonal, is made of stone and is more symmetrical and regular in shape. Colour  dominates the rear fa\u00e7ade of the building which overlooks Carrer Rossell\u00f3.  Be sure not to miss the other side. Both the sides are spectacular. Even if you cannot visit the interior,  it's still worth a visit just to admire it from the outside. The architecture and the interior are stunning. One of my  favourite houses  in Barcelona.
