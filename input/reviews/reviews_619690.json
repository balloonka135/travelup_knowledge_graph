Anyone under 12 will just find it boring. That's why the Museum goes out of its' way to advise the visitor that if you want to participate in any of its' activities - workshops,chocolate tasting, lollipops workshops etc... - you must book in advance. I got bowled over by a party of young kids aged between 5 and 12 because I stood between them and the museum kitchen where the workshops take place. It is only this part of the museum that will appeal to children directly and it is obviously over-subscribed.\nThis is first and foremost a museum that describes how the cacao bean was discovered, how it became important over the centuries,how countries fought over controlling it and how it became the \"chocolate\" that we know today. Making the assumption that the museum is just about the taste of chocolate and why children might like it because of that, is more a product of careless parenting or people with too much of a sweet tooth. \nSo bear that in mind when you look at the \"terrible\" reviews as there is a lot to read and digest here if you want to learn about chocolate and how it has become part of our social and culinary landscape. The museum has tried to make the story of chocolate user-friendly and fascinating but it will not hold the attention of a precocious child who just wants to eat it.Where it comes from,how it was made in the past contrasted with how it is made now,how it was and is marketed  - all of this is presented with fascinating audio-visual tableaux. If any child or teenager walks past the dioramas showing the faithful representations of literary characters such as Don Quixote,Asterix and Obelix,Tintin and his fellow adventurers - then you know that they suffer from a deeply-flawed upbringing.\nThen there is a section that shows the antique machinery used in the making of chocolate and photographs of the \"chocolatiers\" who have made Barcelona a centre of chocolate excellence. There is also an area that shows works created for the Annual Chocolate Sculptures Contest and it is here that you are viewing the creative skills of these artists. This is truly at the other end of the spectrum from the production line of Cadbury's \"Dairy Milk\" bars. Stick around for the video that shows how a reproduction of Thomas the Tank Engine is made from chocolate. Then you realise that the chocolate bar that you used to get into this museum is not just made from any chocolate.\nWhen you are done with the museum, you exit into the coffee shop where there are on sale a truly mind-boggling selection of flavoured and pure chocolate products made especially for the museum. It might seem expensive but you are not buying \"ordinary\" here. You are buying a piece of Barcelona's culinary history. It is to be savoured not gorged.\n A note of caution,don't be seduced into buying a large cup of hot chocolate from Barcelona with what looks like a simple chocolate croissant,unless you are truly ravenous and intend walking around Barcelona for the rest of the day.
