We were lucky enough to be entertained by Eddie Izzard and the evening was spectacularly good in a small intimate theatre environment with about 100 other people. The seating arrangement with small tables for groups of five or six people was great and the well stocked bar sold drinks at below average prices for a city like Barcelona. Well done to the owners and managers of this club; it is great.", "publishedDate": "2016-12-01", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
