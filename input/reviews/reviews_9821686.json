Inside there were birds tweeting, children playing and otherwise it was quiet amongst this soft ambience. There were mandarin trees with fresh oranges ready to pick and the architecture of the gardens (a former hospital) was stunning. A welcome respite from the hustle and bustle all around it. \n\nWe couldn\u2019t quite believe our luck finding Jardins de Rubi\u00f3, where we enjoyed our cone and wondered further into the square where we found another hidden gem, a homely terrace cafe and tapas bar called El Jard\u00ed, where we had a Ros\u00e9 and a pint of Estrella Damn!\n\nWhilst this isn\u2019t on any of the tourist guides of Barcelona, it will absolutely remain one of our most memorable occasions.

It is a pretty spot, but the attraction of the architecture and the garden was marred somewhat by the sensation of not feeling safe.  There were a lot of homeless people there, either sleeping rough (they were not threatening in any way), but also congregating in small groups and these latter folk were quite aggressive via voice and body language. We did not stay long as we felt, as tourists, that we were impinging on their space (we probably were).

It said at the side of it (in Spanish) something like Pharmacy Academy so of course we went into explore.  We were surprised to see what a big space it is through the arch. We assumed that building to the left was the Pharmacy Academy.  In the middle of the garden there are lots of white roses which were just starting to bloom and further on a beautiful water feature with orange trees.  Also in the square the Bibliotecta de Catalunya.   We were very impressed to see this lovely garden.  The exit at the other end of garden is into Carrer Carme.   If  you are in this area of Lower Raval it is worth visiting this hidden gem of a garden.  The surrounding buildings are nice too!", "publishedDate": "2016-05-23", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
