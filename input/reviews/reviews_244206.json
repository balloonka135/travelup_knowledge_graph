I felt the location easy to find, and would definitely recommend it for either the way down the hill from fort (climbing up would be rough!) or else in conjunction with the Art museum and/or fountains, which are very close.\n\nThe cons: Everything is in Catalan, most things are also in Spanish, and a very small number of things are in English. The entire first section can't really be understood if you're a tourist, although you can get the gist of it. The A/C in the first half is nice, but when you get to the big room, it doesn't have any, which makes the last room (on the second floor) hot.

It wasn't in her guide book which she surfed as she drove; that's like a Six Flags ride! The museum was very empty of humans, just like the reviews indicated. At times the lights were too dim, the labels were in Catalonian or Spanish and the director of this museum has truly missed the boat when it comes to attracting visitors. It was well designed, well organized and small enough to enjoy within an hour or two. You got a picture of life in Catalonia from neolithic times to the middle ages and having a Spanish friend help with the descriptions was an asset. If you like museums you'll appreciate this one.
