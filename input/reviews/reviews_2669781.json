It's great fun. I had a blast. Trampoline and the bubble are superb. All the things that are there are 6 euros but if you more tickets it's better value and we got ignored by the staff even though he saw us waiting.", "publishedDate": "2019-12-29", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 564120115, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2669781-r564120115-Bubbleparc-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "Came across this place when walking around the back outdoor area of the shopping centre (see pic).

Bungee jumping was great fun for my eleven yr old, a group of teenage girls and a couple of little kids. The other activities were a bust. Was way too hot for the bikes and the water bubbles. My kid came out soaked with sweat and unhappy! 6\u20ac for each turn or 15\u20ac for 3. Overall, different and pretty cheap activity if you're in the area in Barcelona.", "publishedDate": "2014-07-30", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
