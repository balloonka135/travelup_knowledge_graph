This is across the road from the Maritime Museum.  Had we been to this Museum the cost of entry was included in their ticket price.  As we hadn't it cost \u20ac3 to go aboard. There are printed leaflets on board in several different languages.  It was the first time that we had been aboard a schooner and interesting  to see how small it was below decks. The access steps to the lower decks are quite steep.  It was built in Alicante in 1918  It had a varied life sailing the Med and with a couple of voyages to Cuba.  Eventually it had an engine installed.  After a rather chequered career it was acquired by the Maritime museum in 1997.  Then restored to its original state.  It is worth visiting to imagine how the crew would have lived and worked aboard this boat.  Even moored every little movement of the boat made the timbers creak and groan!!", "publishedDate": "2016-05-26", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 327676013, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8685987-r327676013-Pailebot_de_Santa_Eulalia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We were the only visitors on the ship on this November day. There was only one staff person on board, no printed leaflet or guide, and no interest from the staff member. He indicated that we could go anywhere that was open, and we did, but there was no life in this ship, nor did it seem to be loved.  \nA visit to this schooner is included in the admission price for the Maritime Museum nearby.", "publishedDate": "2015-11-18", "language": "en", "rating": 3}]}}]
