It's basically just a short underground metro that goes a little steeper. However it is very useful for getting you halfway up Montjuic hill right outside the cable car station. You can use your metro T10 pass to go on it, however we did have to queue and then wait 10 mins for it to set off", "publishedDate": "2019-10-03", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 715008057, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d17639374-r715008057-Montjuic_Funicular-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "A nice funicular if you like this sort of thing and I do. part of the Barcelona transport ticket and runs very frequently.

We decided that to access the Montjuic area we would take the Metro to the funicular and then walk from there.  The funicular leaves every 10 minutes, so we waited for it to come and then the ride was super short.  When we got off, we had quite a walk to get to Plaza Espana.  I can see how it was exciting when it was new for the world fair, but I would skip this attraction and ride the metro to Plaza Espana.  If you really want to ride the funicular, maybe ride it and then ride back to the metro.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-01", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 685239784, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d17639374-r685239784-Montjuic_Funicular-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This is a train that goes up an incline.

On one of the days we wound up on top of the hilltop overlooking the city and harbor.\n\nWe thought the entrance for the Teleferico del Puerto was here but the taxi driver let us off in the wrong spot. So we decided to take the Funicular down to the Metro to head over to take in more sights. The Montjuic Funicular was a short ride and mostly in a tunnel. But when you get on the tram is in a open air trench and you do get a couple of quick views....\n\nBeing a \"railfan\" I enjoyed this unique tram ride going vertically down the hillside. If you are in the area of the Montjuic Funicular, give it a ride...You will probably enjoy it too.", "publishedDate": "2019-06-21", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 682786252, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d17639374-r682786252-Montjuic_Funicular-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We decided to do as much sightseeing as we could the first five days we were in Barcelona and tried to take in as much as we could.....\n\nWe just happened up the Funicular de Montjuic by accident and since I am a \"railfan\" we just had to ride it. We were at the top station and took the short ride down the hillside to the Metro station at the bottom where we took a subway to get back to our hotel.\n\nWhile this may not be a major attraction, we both enjoyed the ride and it is really a ride that you do not see that often...So give the Funicular de Montjuic a try.....", "publishedDate": "2019-06-19", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
