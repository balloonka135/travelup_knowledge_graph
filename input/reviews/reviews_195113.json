Based on the web site, we parked at Vall d'Hebron parking at 10.00am. There is a free bus to the park but only 2 buses were running (20-25 min ride). I guess most of people want to go at opening time. We had to wait for 3 buses (more than 1 hour waiting). The cue was in a sunny area with no shade. Can you imagine waiting to go to an attraction park with 2 kids in the sun?\n2. A couple of attractions were very slow due to the personal. Specially, I need to mention the driving experience for kids. With a bit of energy from the team, the cues could be reduced easily.\n3. We left the Kruger Hotel for the afternoon as top site. We went there before 5pm being aware of a potential long cue. Surprinsigly, we were told that the attraction was closed until 9pm. There were people cuing which would enter until 6.30. But then, actors had to stop for a couple of hours. The only option was to wait until 9pm (and start cueing at 7.30pm). Would you be waiting from 5 to 9pm with 2 little kids? I agree that actors need to take breaks, but what about having 2 teams of actors in pick days? It is diffcult to understand that a top attraction is closed from 7 to 9pm. We left the park with a frustating feeling.\n4. Food stations. The park allows to bring food from home (very good!). At lunch we approached one station for sandwiches and drinks. No sandwiches available, and only beer or water. They were not prepared to cope with the demand.

I literally planned my third trip to BCN for the sole purpose of finally getting to Tibidabo.  On the day my friend and I decided to get to Tibidabo, we left our hotel at 8 am and easily took the metro and train to the stop and then hopped on a bus.  Unfortunately, the bus dropped us off at the funicular, which was out of service.  By the looks of things, it had been inactive for quite some time. We were assured by several nearby restaurant employees that taxis come here every five minutes to take us to the amusement park.  We waited over 30 minutes.  In that time, more and more buses were dropping off tourists who also had expected to take the funicular to Tibidabo.  I'm not sure why it's not more advertised that the funicular is defective.  Eventually a taxi arrived, so we hopped into it with 4 Ukrainian visitors and for 16 euros, we made it to the park and church area.  The park wasn't open until 11, and even though it was 10:58, we were told to wait. (Yes, you're reading things correctly - it took nearly 3 hours to get there.  Granted that included a 30 minute wait for a taxi, but still.) We parted ways with our new friends and decided to go to the church, which was spectacular.  I climbed all the way to the top for stunning views of Barcelona.  (Though, to be honest, you can go to numerous spots for similar pictures.) Before leaving the States, my friend had been adamant that we buy tickets for the park in advance.  She wanted to purchase the one that allowed us unlimited rides, which was roughly $30.  I begrudgingly agreed.  When we were at the amusement park, the lady at the counter told us that the rides weren't all functioning and told us we should buy a cheaper ticket and use the one we had purchased for a different day.  Well, I wasn't planning on coming back, so I overpaid for the park.  There were only 4 rides open.  We went on a Thursday in March, and it was pretty dead.  I think in total we were at the church and park for about 2 hours, which was significantly less time than it took to get to the actual park.  Maybe because I had glorified this part of Barcelona in my head for several years, but I left feeling disappointed.  Perhaps I missed something in my numerous Google searches, but the fact that the funicular wasn't working, that it took 30 minutes for a taxi, and that the majority of the rides weren't open didn't equal to a pleasant morning.  Yes, the views were stunning, but I wouldn't go back to Tibidabo if I make it to Barcelona a 4th time.", "publishedDate": "2019-04-11", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 664471084, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d195113-r664471084-Parc_d_Atraccions_Tibidabo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I always meant to visit the \u2018Magic Mountain\u2019 but it always seemed like a real trek to get to.
