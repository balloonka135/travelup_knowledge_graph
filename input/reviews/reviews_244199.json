So after we saw the cathedral (for the 2nd time) because it was close to our hotel, we decided to go here because it is next door, we didn't have much energy (my wife was just recovering from 3 and 1/2 days of staying in the hotel because she was sick) and we thought we wouldn't need much time. We were wrong about how long it would take. The collection is much larger than we suspected. And it was good and diverse. It's almost impossible to describe the range of objects. Go to the website for an idea. We actually pooped out after we spent a short  amount of time on the third floor. We had spent maybe two hours and to finish up, we might have had to spend two more. It's a lot.\n\nThis was supposed to be a kind of throw away, doing it simply because it was convenient. It turned out to be much more, worthy of consideration for all tourists. For a new visitor to Barcelona with just a few days, would I come here? No. There are other places that are far more essential that can easily fill up 4-5 days.

He must have been one of those collectors that have the magpie instinct, collecting everything from keys and cards to religious masterpieces. So the first floor exhibits early Christian art, from the 12th and 13th century, and it is superb. It can really lift you up: the simple, somewhat primitive sculptures of Mother and Child, Jesus on the cross and Calvary groups is truly outstanding, so much that you get ready to forgive the catholic church for its crimes against humanity, their destruction of cultures and their inquisition. Wow. But then you go to the second floor, where the Christian art becomes overbearing, pathetic and exaggerated, and your mood can sower. A saving grace are a few superb paintings that are very enjoyable. Then, last, if you go to the third and fourth floors, the magpie instinct of the collector becomes ridiculous.

The basement and first two floors feature mostly religious sculpture from the 5th century B.C.E. through the 19th century.  The \u201cCollector\u2019s Cabinet\u201d on the second (and a small part of the third) floor is densely packed with tens of thousands of daily objects.  The second floor also contains a \u201clibrary-study\u201d dedicated to the sculptures of Frederic Mares himself.  According to the wall text, the building has a checkered past \u2013 it was, for a time, the seat of the Inquisition in Barcelona.\n\nIf you are into the history of sculptural depictions of the Virgin and Child, Christ on the Cross, and Calvary, the first two floors of this museum are for you.  The floors include row after row of similar Virgins with similar Children, and countless walls filled with larger than life crucified Christs \u2013 in a variety of styles.  If you are an aficionado and can distinguish among the often very subtle differences, you will love this part of the museum. If not, you will be awed by the volume and moved by some of the images, but ultimately, may glaze over.  But even for the glassy-eyed, there are numerous noteworthy pieces that stand out and make a visit worthwhile \u2013 the relief by the Master of Cabestany of Christ standing on the sea before two disciples in a boat, with roiling water and stylized fish below; the arresting painting of Jesus on the Road to Calvary by 15th century Catalan master Jaume Hugeut; a tiny collection of hundreds of miniature bronze figures; and more.   In addition, the basement is focused on stone sculpture and includes, among other things, an intact portal/fa\u00e7ade of a 13th century church.\n\nThe second floor, the so-called \u201cCollector\u2019s Cabinet\u201d is extraordinary, with rooms dedicated to various activities, each containing hundreds, if not thousands, of objects reflecting daily life, often from the 1800s and early 1900s, but in places, earlier.  For example, the room focused on women\u2019s fashion, includes hundreds of fans in addition to other objects.  The \u201cWeapons Hall\u201d includes centuries-old armor, swords, guns and cross-bows.  The \u201cSmoker\u2019s Hall\u201d includes thousands of 19th century artifacts related to all forms of tobacco use, including racy matchbook covers and elaborately carved pipes.  The collection of wrought iron is also remarkable, as is the collection of tin soldiers.\n\nThe Mares study includes numerous fine examples of sculpture by Mares himself, and is worth the price of admission.  Finally, don\u2019t miss a small room on the second floor called the \u201cScenic Overlook,\u201d which includes a high window into the Salo de Tinell, the monumental gothic hall, which is part of the Museum of the History of Barcelona.  The view from above is worth seeing.\n\nOn balance, the Mares Museum may not crack my top-10 list of sites in Barcelona, but it is a unique and fascinating place that deserves a visit if you can find the time.  My suggestion would be to start on with the Collector\u2019s Cabinet and Mares Study, and work down.

The Romanesque period and the Gothic period is the time frame of most of the religious statutes he collected. The collection is overwhelming but then you move in to other things he collected and you are truly blown away buy the objects and curiosities he collected. It is hard to describe because there is so much there to see. The ticket gives you the opportunity to visit again within 30 days and it is great tat they do that because if you do it in one visit you have sensory overload.
