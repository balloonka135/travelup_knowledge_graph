Shade trees on either side and in the roundabout circles at intersections.  Park benches and outdoor cafes to enjoy the area.  The rambla leads you right to the beach.  Not too many hotels here, but the Holiday Inn Express, while without local character, was adequate.  There are Metro stops two or three blocks either side of the rambla - Poblenou and LLacuna.", "publishedDate": "2015-07-09", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 280147289, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7208916-r280147289-Rambla_del_Poblenou-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "We recently stayed in Poblenou whilst on a group visit for Primavera Sound. 4 lads and me and my boyfriend.\n\nThe boys enjoyed the Poblenou Ramblas with us for delicious tapas (Lazzurano was our favourite. Little \u20ac1 pinchos they would cook and bring round for you to take if you want. SO GOOD. Nice beer and outside seating. \n\nSODA cocktail bar was amazing. The best pi\u00f1a colada I have ever had and I have had A LOT of pi\u00f1a coladas. \n\nLots of other great places to eat and drink for pretty cheap. We were concerned that lots of people had said Poblenou was bad for crime and not good for tourists but it was excellent.\n\nWe frequented the Irish bar a fair bit but mostly it's Spanish food and it's all so good. There's also some great shops and a decent amount of supermarket type shops handy if you're staying self catering.\n\nThe lads went out drinking at la Ramblas most nights then onto clubs as the Poblenou Ramblas sort of shut down around midnight in May/June. Not sure if they stay open later in the summer but me and my boyfriend spent some beautiful warm evenings wandering up the Poblenou Ramblas stopping outside various places and lapping up the architecture. \n\nIf you're up for a chilled time it's the place to go.", "publishedDate": "2015-06-14", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 277972607, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d7208916-r277972607-Rambla_del_Poblenou-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "I love walking from Diagonal Mar to the ocean through la Rambla del Poblenou. There are many restaurants along the way and lots of people having a great time, eating or drinking within the restaurants or at the tables outside. \n\nDuring my last visit there were several important soccer games being played, and it was funny to see that those bars/restaurants with the larger screens or TVs had the largest crowds. It was fun walking by and observing all the excitement. \n\nIts a fun street, with lots of people but never too crowded  In this and the other ramblas you see  many older couples walking hand in hand; very nice elderly and elegant couples. \n\n This time I started exploring some of the side streets and discovering some of the smaller shops. The Rambla del Poblenou has elegance and style and a nice breeze as you approach the ocean. I found a good place for coffee cups - including my Soc del Poblenous coffee cup.", "publishedDate": "2015-06-04", "language": "en", "rating": 5}]}}]
