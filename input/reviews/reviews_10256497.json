It has a nice little lake with banks of red fish, shadow, a few benches and even a little terrace where you can get a refreshment. It's not a destination in itself, though probably the residents in the area enjoy it a lot in the evening.", "publishedDate": "2017-06-29", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 474863870, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10256497-r474863870-Parque_Turo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "It's a regular park, not so big, and locals use to take their dogs, kids, and sometimes they do some jogging there. Not so good to make a picnic, if it's a sunny day you could take a sandwich there.", "publishedDate": "2017-04-11", "language": "en", "rating": 3}]}}]
