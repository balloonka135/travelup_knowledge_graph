By the standards of Modernism, it\u2019s a fairly simple building and lacks the opulent decoration that make it\u2019s architectural style obvious. The facade is simply decorated with rectangular tiles of various hues of light blue. On the first floor, just above the entrance to the building is a stained glass window clearly influence by Art Nouveau. Directly above that are decorations that show both the building\u2019s original purpose and it\u2019s Modernista influences. The cornice is richly decorated with floral motifs and the roof is crowned with architectural sculptures, evidence of it\u2019s Modernism influences. Other Modernista elements include the semi-circular balconies with wrought-iron railings and ceramic mosaic bannisters inside the building. The  sculptural relief depicts allegory of infancy, alludes to the building\u2019s origins.\n\nAlthough, interesting on it\u2019s own, it\u2019s only worth a detour if you have an abiding interest in Catalan Modernism. There are many monumental and more important examples of this style throughout Barcelona.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-16", "language": "en", "rating": 3}, {"id": 672773513, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10538541-r672773513-Casa_de_la_Lactancia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This building of Catalan Modernism was completed in 1913.
