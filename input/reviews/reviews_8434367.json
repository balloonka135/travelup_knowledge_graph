And most of the people who were there, had not paid entrance, since they sneak through an abandoned rear part of the building, a dangerous part full of thieves waiting to rob tourists (see other comments to check). A lot of these dangerous people are the ones you later find by the pool and, logically, they have not paid entrance.

We were not disappointed! \n\nIt is easy to get to. A short journey on a small shuttle train from the Parallel metro station. You can use your T10 tickets for this service. Straight out of the station and the pool is opposite to the right. Reasonably priced at 6.50 for adults and 4.50 for kids. There are sun beds to hire for 1euro each although they go quickly. However, you can put yourself on the waiting list and the lifeguards bring them over when they become available. \n\nThe pool is big and there is plenty of room as a lot of people sunbathe. I counted 80 people there but only 25 in the pool. It's great with slightly older kids as they can jump in as much as they want without disturbing people whilst I got to sunbathe and swim lengths with plenty of room. \n\nThe best bit though is the absolutely stunning views across barcelona which are amazing to see either from a sunbed or as you swim.\n\nSome points to note:\n- this was the diving pool for the Olympics but the diving boards aren't open to the public\n- there are no lockers so don't take any valuables\n- there is nowhere to buy food or drink so take some with you. We took a picnic which was great as we stayed for several hours without spending any extra money on overpriced drinks or snacks!", "publishedDate": "2015-08-29", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 292404211, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d8434367-r292404211-Piscina_Municipal_de_Montjuic-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "What a great find!! We visited here after it was recommended by our tour guide. It is accessible via the funicular or bus. The huge 1992 Olympic swimming pool is open to the public and is set on the side of Montjuic hill, boasting some incredible views over the city. It costs \u20ac6.50 for adults and there is plenty of room to sunbathe around the pool, but there's only a limited number of sun beds available. We found it much quieter than the Barcelona beaches and the pool was lovely to cool off in.
