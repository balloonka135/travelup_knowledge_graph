Just a city park - but with weird and wonderful towers and lamps and bike racks, all the ordinary park things - but with a mischevious twist!  All centered on an old brick tower around which fanciful gardening has been planted.  I ran round and round in it a bit, just enjoying the mod/weird of it, before too many people and dogs and strollers chased me back out.  Worth 15 minutes if you happen by!", "publishedDate": "2019-12-30", "language": "en", "rating": 5}, {"id": 376869644, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d4752027-r376869644-Parque_del_Centro_de_Poblenou-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "lovely flowers n plants. arty structures and lghts. lots of seats n stuff for chldren to play on too.", "publishedDate": "2016-05-26", "language": "en", "rating": 4}]}}]
