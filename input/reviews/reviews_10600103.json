Although I\u2019m told that it\u2019s a Modernista building, I actually think it\u2019s close to Neo-Gothic with it long strait lines, ribbed windows frames and mock medieval bay windows. True, there are the characteristic sumptuous ceramic tiles on the roofs of the arched entrance and house. It still looks like something like a building out of the middle ages, which I suppose is part of it\u2019s charm.\n\nIf you have a love of Modernism or have time, then this is worth a look. Otherwise, there are plenty of buildings Modernism that are truly monumental and must-see in Barcelona.\n\nNote: I only realised afterwards that this building was in fact also a museum with a mix of permanent and changing exhibitions and I only saw this building from the outside.", "publishedDate": "2019-07-16", "language": "en", "rating": 4}, {"id": 672771235, "absoluteUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d10600103-r672771235-Casa_Golferichs-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "text": "This house of Catalan Modernism can be found from the main street Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes.
