I had been vaguely aware that Orwell spent a little time in Barcelona (or in Catalonia at least), but knew nothing of the circumstances. It wasn't far from the hotel, so I marched off to see it, assuming there would be an informative plaque, and that his homesite might be open for tours. \n\nWhat a disappointment. I learned that George Orwell never lived at Placa George Orwell; in fact it's known as \u201cPlaca del Tripi\u201d by the locals! The decision to bestow Orwell's name on this place was apparently made only in March,1996 by local government officials, possibly due to the fact that Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War for the Republican side. \n\nWhat is eerily prescient about naming the plaza after Orwell is this: In 2001, Placa George Orwell became the first public space in Barcelona to be controlled by municipal video surveillance cameras! Think about that for a moment (or read 1984 if you need a refresher). \n\nAnd so, if you're a George Orwell fan, and you want to ponder his life while you're in Barcelona, I'd suggest that instead of visiting the plaza named after him, you read 'Homage to Catalonia', and take a stroll down La Rambla. Many of the places he described are still recognizable. Here are a few other references if you're interested: \n\n[REMOVED per TripAdvisor censorship...
